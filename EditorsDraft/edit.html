    <section id='abstract'>
This specification introduces a data model to support the publication of data describing
opportunities for people to engage in physical activities ("opportunity data"). This model
covers description of activities, as well as the events and locations in which they take place.

The specification is intended to support the publication of opportunity data as open data
for anyone to access, use and share. It will also guide reusers of opportunity data,
introducing them to the key concepts relevant to that sector.

The model may also be useful in guiding the development of both new and existing booking
systems and applications that consume opportunity data.

The specification is an output of the [OpenActive Community Group](http://www.w3.org/community/openactive/)
and serves as a common reference point for other specifications and outputs of that activity.

Developers looking for a quick primer on the model and how to use it to structure opportunity data may want to refer to the
[[Publishing-Opportunity-Data]] primer which provides a number of additional examples.

The data model introduced in this document has been mapped to existing standards and vocabularies, including
SKOS ([[SKOS]]) and the Schema.org ([[SCHEMA-ORG]]) types and properties. This existing work provides a
useful existing framework around which the
[OpenActive Community Group](http://www.w3.org/community/openactive/) can build additional data standards.

# Introduction

The [W3C OpenActive Community Group](http://www.w3.org/community/openactive/) was
established with the objective of facilitating the sharing and use of
physical activity data. Open publishing of this data has enormous potential to increase
participation in physical activities.

## Categories of Physical Activity Data

There are several different categories of data that are relevant to physical activities.
This data covers different parts of [the data spectrum](http://theodi.org/data-spectrum)
and is represented in the following diagram.

    <figure>
![](images/opportunity-data.png)
<figcaption>Types of physical activity data</figcaption>
    </figure>

Some of this data is shared data. It can only be accessed by
specific people or groups, under terms and conditions that define how and when
it can be accessed and used. This shared data includes personal data about
people taking part in activities and participation data that describes how people have
been involved in previous events.

Some of this data can be open data. Open data is data that anyone can access, use and share.
All of the following types of data can be published as open data:

* descriptions and lists of physical activities
* details of the locations and venues at which activities or events takes place
* the facilities available at those locations
* the details of event involving physical activities e.g. when and where they will take place, restrictions
on attendance, costs, etc
* any related information, e.g. about the format of the event, its organisers, etc

Collectively this is known as __*opportunity data*__.

## Requirements

This specification has been developed to meet a broad set of requirements.

### Support all types of opportunity data

As described in the previous section, opportunity data covers a variety of different types of
information including data on venues, activities and events. The specification should support
publication of all of these different types of data

### Support discovery of opportunities

The aim of the OpenActive initiative is to encourage people to be more physically active. This means
that this specification should focus on the data that will help people discover these
opportunities.

### Support all physical activities

The specification should be inclusive and support sharing of opportunity data about
all types of physical activities, not just sports.

### Allow sharing of activity lists

At present the physical activity sector does not have a standard list of physical activities.
The specification should allow data providers to share the lists they have and support the
sector in moving towards a standardised list of physical activities

### Support a variety of sources

Opportunity data is collected and held in a variety of different tools, platforms and websites.
There is variation in the amount of detail held about individual events so the specification must
provide flexibility to share what data is currently available, whilst guiding activity providers
towards additional useful data to collect about events.

### Be agnostic to formats and APIs

Reflecting the wide variety of tools and platforms in use, and also that the sector is at an
early stage in sharing its data more widely, this specification should not prescribe specific
data formats or APIs. Ideally opportunity data could be published as JSON, XML, CSV or other formats.

### Create an extensible framework

This specification should support extensions to allow it to be customised and revised to meet future
requirements, as well as the needs of specific communities of data publishers and consumers.

## Scope

This specification defines a data model for opportunity data. This reflects the goal of
[the OpenActive initiative](https://www.openactive.io/) whose aim is to
encourage the publishing and reuse of open data that might help people to become
more active.

The following items are therefore out of scope for this specification:

* booking and related activities, e.g. availability, booking process and membership packages
* participation data, e.g. statistics on attendance
* personal information, demographics and other information about event participants
* APIs for publishing and discovering opportunity data

Support for third-party bookings is covered in the draft [[Open-Booking-API]]
specification.

The [OpenActive Community Group](http://www.w3.org/community/openactive/) may
produce additional specifications that address the other areas.

## Structure of this document

This specification is divided into two main sections:

1. **Introduction** - provides a broad definition of opportunity data and goals for this specification
2. **Key Concepts** - describes the key types of resources relevant to opportunity data, along with their relationships and common attributes
3. **Data Model** - a data model that maps the key concepts to some standard vocabularies

# Key Concepts

This section introduces the high-level data model for opportunity data. This includes a
description of the:

* the resources that are relevant to opportunity data, e.g. places, events, activities, etc
* the relationships between those resources
* the main attributes that help to describe those resources, e.g. names, dates, etc

The model also helps to provide definitions of key terms that are used throughout this
specification.

## Data Model Diagram

This diagram illustrates the resources and relationships that are introduced in the following sections.

    <figure>
![](images/schema-diagram.png)
<figcaption>Opportunity data schema diagram</figcaption>
    </figure>

## Physical Activities

A __*Physical Activity*__ is an exercise, sport or other form of bodily movement
that involves physical effort. Physical activities will usually have a well-understood,
dictionary definition.

Examples of Physical Activities include walking, running, cycling, rugby, football and tennis

Activities should have a name. They might also be associated with one of more synonyms
that provide alternative names for that activity. E.g. "Soccer" is a synonym
for "Football". This additional information may be useful to help improve search engines and
improve data collection.

Physical Activities may also have additional information associated with them.
For example a sporting activity might be overseen by a governing body or federation.

Physical Activities might also be recognised by different bodies. In the UK certain
activities are recognised as suitable for educational assessments, while others
may be recognised by funding bodies like Sport England.

An __*Activity List*__ describes a set of Physical Activities. An Activity List may be a
simple list of activity names. But an Activity List might also capture additional information.
A common requirement is to describe relationships between Physical Activities.

One method of grouping activities is to define "broader" and "narrower" relationships.
For example Judo, Karate and Kendo are all more specific examples of the broader activity of
"Martial Arts".

<ul>
<li>Martial Arts
<ul><li>Karate</li>
<li>Kendo</li>
<li>Judo</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

This type of grouping could also be used to describe the disciplines associated with
Physical Activities. For example olympic and open water swimming.

An Activity List might also group Physical Activities into collections. For example
swimming, water aerobics, and water polo might all be classified as "Water Sports".
Water polo and football might also be grouped into a collection of "Team Sports".

<ul>
<li>Team Sports
<ul><li>Football</li>
<li>Water Polo</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Water Sports
<ul><li>Swimming</li>
<li>Water Aerobics</li>
<li>Water Polo</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

An Activity List may include any number of collections of Physical Activities. As shown in the
example above, an individual Physical Activity might be present in more than one grouping.

Some systems may choose to use grouping and hierarchical relationships between
Physical Activities to help people find opportunities to be active. For example
a search engine might offer users results for all types of Martial Art, or for Karate specifically.

<div class="note">
The proposed model for Activity Lists is based on the [[SKOS]] standard for publishing controlled
vocabularies.
</div>

<div class="note">
It is not a requirement that systems store, publish or use relationships between
Physical Activities. A system may choose to treat Physical Activities as simple tags
or categories associated with Events. Other systems may define a fixed list of
Physical Activities that are used as a controlled vocabulary to guides user input
and data collection. Others may adopt a more complex hierarchical approach.
</div>

<div class="note">
<p>__Developing a standard activity list__</p>
<p>This specification doesn't place any requirements on how applications manage
or use Physical Activities or Activity Lists. There is no requirement that applications that
implement this specification must adopt a single standardised list, or agree on standard groupings. The intention
here is to just capture a useful model that can represent the variety of data currently in use.
</p>
<p>However there are benefits to the physical activity sector in convergence on a standard list of
activities in order to improve discovery, reporting, etc. The OpenActive Community Group are developing
a standard list as a separate activity. For more information see [[OpenActive-Activity-List]].
</div>

## Events

An __*Event*__ is an opportunity to take part in a Physical Activity. Events take place at a
specific location (see below) at an agreed date and time.

Some Events are one-off occurrences. For example a fun run organised by a local group
may run as a standalone event on a particular date.

Other events take place on a regular __schedule__. For example a weekly gym class may
run every Wednesday evening at 7pm. While a local walking club might meet on a Saturday
morning once a month.

It is useful to publish data about both individual Events and those with recurring schedules.
People looking for opportunities to be active will be interested in both specific questions
("what can I do tomorrow") and more general information about scheduled activities.

For some scheduled events, participants may not have to commit to attending every
session. They can drop-in for individual classes, or build up a regular habit to
improve their fitness. For other events, like a course, there is might be an
expectation that a participant will attend every class.

Some large scale events, such as a family fun day, might consist of a programme
of smaller scheduled events that take place over the course of a single or multiple
days.

In order to simplify terminology in this specification we use the term "Event"
to refer to all types of opportunities, including one-off and
regularly occurring events. However in the detailed data model we distinguish
between some types of events to allow data users to better present opportunities
to potential participants.

Regardless of what type of an event is being described, there
is a range of additional information that may help describe the event to potential participants.
This includes:

* the Physical Activity or Activities that will take place at the event
* the location (Place or Venue) in which it is taking place
* the Organiser of the event, which might be a person or an organisation
* the Programme used to structure the event
* descriptive attributes, such as its suitability for specific age or weight ranges
* general category information to tag the event as suitable for certain fitness levels, intensity, etc
* booking information, including price, attendance numbers and method of booking

<div class="note">
<p>There are a variety of ways to categorise and describe events. This includes restrictions on attendance,
aspect of suitability for different audiences and fitness levels, and a mixture of pre-requisites such as the
need for certain qualifications, membership or equipment.
</p>
<p>
The initial version of this specification prioritises capturing the essential elements of describing an event. The
structured information about time, place and activity is supplemented with some basic descriptive properties.
This also includes the ability to add "tags" to an event to capture a variety of categorisation elements. Future
versions of this specification will use experience working with real-world data to decide the best approach of
formalising these categories.
</p>
</div>

## Organisers (Persons and Organizations)

Events have __*organisers*__. An event organiser might be a __*Person*__ or an __*Organization*__.
The organiser of an event is the person or organisation who arranged and/or hosts the event. The organizer
will be the person or organisation who is ultimately responsible for an Event.

Examples of organisers might be coaches, or a local sports club.

Events may involve other named individuals or organisations. Examples might include named staff who will be participating
in the event in addition to the main organiser. These are referred to as __*contributors*__.

In addition to their names, some systems may have additional information about organisers and contributors.
E.g. links to their web sites, photos, logos or contact details.

<div class="note">
<p>__Applications must not publish personal data without permission__</p>
<p>
This specification provides a data model for publishing information about individual people, e.g. coaches,
volunteers, etc. However applications <em class="rfc2119">MUST</em> respect privacy and data protection laws and must not publish
data about individuals without their consent.
</p>
<p>
The ability to publish this type of data has been included because event organisers often choose to publicly
share some information about themselves to help advertise an event. E.g. their name and some background on
their qualifications or experience. But this information <em class="rfc2119">MUST</em> not be published as open data without getting the
consent of the individual concerned.
</p>
</div>

## Places

Events take place in a __*location*__. But, depending on the activity, the location
may be defined to different levels of precision. For example:

* A gym class may take place in a leisure centre at a specific address or other precisely defined location
* A cycling or walking event might start at a specific location, but will subsequently follow a route
* An exercise or running group might meet in an area of a local park, rather than at a specific address

In addition to this, data publishers will have different approaches for capturing location data.

Recognising this need for flexibility, this model proposes that a location can be specified as any of the
following:

* a description, e.g. "Meet by the lake, in Victoria Park"
* an address
* a venue, such as a leisure centre, which might have an address and/or a latitude or longitude
* a facility within a larger venue, e.g. a football pitch which is part of a leisure centre

This specification uses __*Place*__ as a general concept to refer to all types of locations, venues and facilities.

The concept of Place therefore covers general outdoor areas such as parks, event venues (e.g. a Leisure centre)
and facilities within a venue (e.g. a squash court, running track, etc). Facilities are contained in Places.

A __Sports Activity Location__ is a type of Place that is used to describe a facilities within a broader
Place.

Places may have additional descriptive properties, for example:

* a name
* an address and/or geographic coordinates
* opening hours

## Programmes and Brands

Events are often organised and run in a variety of different ways. This tailoring
might include adjusting the activity to a particular type of participant, demographic.
Or it could include running the event in a particular style, e.g. with a fixed routine
or sequence of activities.

A __*Programme*__ describes a means of organising and running a Physical Activity. Some programmes are very loosely defined.
While others are more structured and may be run to a specific agenda or in a particular style.

Programmes are often associated with branding or marketing that helps participants understand more about what they
can expect from an event of that format. Formats might be offered or overseen by specific organisations

Examples of programmes include:

* Les Mills BodyPump
* Learn to Row, from British Rowing
* Back to Netball, from England Netball

Programmes provide another means of tagging or describing Events to help describe them to
participants. When participants are looking for opportunities they may be interested in
discovering Events based on either the general activity (e.g. Running) or a specific
programme (Back to Netball).

## Offers

Some opportunities are freely available for anyone to attend. Others are only available to members or
paying attendees.

An __*Offer*__ is used to describe the terms under which a participant can pay to attend an event.

<div class="note">
<p>
The concept of an Offer is taken from Schema.org, which itself references the [Good Relations](http://www.heppnetz.de/projects/goodrelations/)
vocabulary for ecommerce. The data model described in a later section is not intended as a
complete specification. The concept is introduced in this version of specification to highlight
the support available in Schema.org for associating offers with events. Later versions of the specification
will explore the area of booking in more detail.
</p>
</div>

## Facility Use and Slots

Not all opportunities to be physically active are scheduled Events. Leisure centres and other locations also provide
facilities (e.g. squash courts, pitches, table tennis tables) that are available for use by participants.

To manage demand these facilities are usually available for hire at specific times of day. These are referred to as __Slots__.
A Slot is an opportunity to use a facility at a specific time and a specific duration, e.g. from 10am for 30 minutes

Some facilities are permanent parts of a leisure centre (or other Place). For example tennis courts, football pitches, etc.

But many leisure centres have flexibility to reconfigure their spaces to support different, often mutually exclusive ways.
For example an individual sports hall might be used as either a single indoor 5-a-side pitch, or as two separate badminton courts.

Modelling the potential configurations of these spaces is outside the scope of this specification. The community group has
chosen to take a more user centred view of describing opportunities to use facilities. This supports our
primary use case of enabling the discovery of opportunities.

A __Facility Use__ is a product that is offered to potential participants. It reflects the ability to use or hire a
facility at a specific location. A platform can publish data about the range of products on offer at a location, updating
their availability as facilities are booked by participants.

The following properties will help to describe the specific Facility Use product on offer:

* basic descriptive attributes of the product, such as its name, description, etc
* the activity or activities for which the facility is to be used
* the location of the facility
* an offer to use the facility, for a specific price
* the Slots during which the product is available, including any associated offers

Some facility use products are opportunities to use a individual, identifiable facility, e.g. Tennis Court 1.
These are referred to a as __Individual Facility Uses__. The location of these products will be a __Sports Activity Location__.

Otherwise, a Facility Use will describe an oppirtunity to use less permanent facilities, e.g. a table tennis table that will be moved into a sports hall on demand, or for an unnamed facility that will be allocated by a platform during booking. In this case the
location will be for the Place in which the facility is available.

Facilities may be offered for use at a single price at any time of day, or the price may vary depending on on which Slot
is used.

As the use of facility is a self-directed activity it will differ from an Event in that is will not be lead, coached, etc.

## Route Guidance

In addition to Events and Facilities hosted by leisure or recreational operators, opportunities for exercise may alse be presented by outdoor trails and pathways suitable for e.g. walking, cycling, horse-riding, etc. For the purposes of this specification, such trails and pathways are referred to as __Routes__, and information about them as __Route Guidance__.

In the OpenActive context, __Routes__ are considered to be a geographical entity: that is to say, the path or trail itself, as characterised by distance, terrain, elevation, and other strictly geographical data points. __Route Guidance__, by contrast, consists of information users might find helpful in accessing or engaging with the __Route__, for instance its starting point, degree of challenge, points of interest, etc.

Note that modelling of __Routes__ themselves is beyond the current scope of this specification, beyond basic provision of a .gpx file or similar for pathfinding. __Route Guidance__, however, **is** within scope, with the intention that such __Metadata__ objects should give users all the information necessary for them to engage with the activity opportunity the __Route__ presents.

Note that __Route Guidance__ objects may exist either as attributes of a scheduled Event or Session (acting as an amenity or resource supporting a planned activity), or as self-standing entitites (simply indicating the existence or availability of a __Route__ for use).

# Data Model

The data model described in the following sections reuses existing standards and vocabularies which
have then been extended to cover the additional requirements needs to support the publication of
opportunity data.

The Simple Knowledge Organisation System ([[SKOS]]) is a W3C standard for publishing taxonomies and
category schemes. It can be used to help publish and organise Activity Lists and to describe
Physical Activities.

Schema.org [[SCHEMA-ORG]] provides an existing well-used and documented data model for publishing
data to the web. It provides an existing model for describing Events, Organisations, People, and
Places.

Both standards are widely used, and can be used to publish data in a variety of structured formats, including
[[JSON-LD]].

The __[*OpenActive Vocabulary*](https://www.openactive.io/ns/)__ [[OpenActive-Vocabulary]] is a custom vocabulary designed to support the publication of
opportunity data. It defines a number of new terms that extend SKOS and Schema.org to cover additional
requirements highlighted in this specification.

<div class="note">
Developers looking for a quick primer on the model and how to use it to structure opportunity data may want to refer to the
[[Publishing-Opportunity-Data]] primer which provides many more examples.
</div>

## Namespaces

The rest of this specification makes use of the following namespaces:

<dl>
<dt>`dc:`</dt>
<dd>`http://purl.org/dc/terms/`</dd>
<dt>`schema:`</dt>
<dd>`https://schema.org/`</dd>
<dt>`skos:`</dt>
<dd>`http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#`</dd>
<dt>`geo:`</dt>
<dd>`http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#`<dd>
<dt>`oa:`</dt>
<dd>`https://openactive.io/`</dd>
</dl>

<div class="note">
<p>
In the following sections all referenced terms have been qualified using their namespace prefix. This highlights the
source vocabulary in which they have been defined. Terms have also been linked to their definitions.
</p>
<p>
The examples in each section use [[JSON-LD]] syntax and reference the [OpenActive JSON-LD context](https://openactive.io/ns/oa.jsonld) defined by [[OpenActive-Vocabulary]], which is accessible at `https://openactive.io/` when using an `Accept` header that includes `application/ld+json`.
</p>
<p>
The context removes the need to use explicit namespace prefixes in the JSON documents. The context also maps the JSON-LD [@type](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#specifying-the-type) and [@id](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#node-identifiers) properties to simple keys (`type` and `id`). This further limits the amount of JSON-LD syntax exposed to developers.
</p>
</div>

## Data Model Overview

The following table provides a high-level summary of how the concepts introduced in the previous sections map to
definitions in SKOS, Schema.org and the OpenActive Vocabulary ([[OpenActive-Vocabulary]]).

|Concept|Mapping|Notes|
|--- |--- |--- |
|Activity List|[skos:ConceptScheme](https://www.w3.org/2009/08/skos-reference/skos.html#ConceptScheme)|Activity lists are controlled vocabularies and map well to the definition of a SKOS Concept Scheme.|
|Physical Activity|[skos:Concept](https://www.w3.org/2009/08/skos-reference/skos.html#Concept)|Individual Physical Activities can be represented as individual SKOS concepts|
|Event|[schema:Event](https://schema.org/Event)|Schema.org provides a well defined model for Events with properties that cover many
of the core requirements for opportunity data. This specification defines some
additional types of Event and properties for describing them in the context of
publishing opportunity data.|
|Place|[schema:Place](https://schema.org/Place)|As well as the general definition of a Place, Schema.org defines sub-types including
[schema:EventVenue](https://schema.org/EventVenue) and [schema:SportsActivityLocation](https://schema.org/SportsActivityLocation) which can be used where appropriate|
|Facility Use|[schema:FacilityUse](https://schema.org/FacilityUse)|Products that describe opportunities to use facilities in a location|
|Organization|[schema:Organization](https://schema.org/Organization)|Covers all types of organisations, including companies, clubs, etc|
|Person|[schema:Person](https://schema.org/Person)|An individual person|
|Brand|[schema:Brand](https://schema.org/Brand)|The brand used to describe a programme of activities.|
|Offer|[schema:Offer](https://schema.org/Offer)|Schema.org provides an existing model for describing offers to pay to participate in an Event.|
|Route Guidance|---|While properties within the Route Guidance model are often drawn from schema.org, the model itself originates with OpenActive.|


## Identifying and Linking Resources

This specification adopts the same approach as Schema.org and encourages the use of URLs as unique identifiers for resources.

Information about Events, Places, Organizations and other types of resources should already have been published online to
make that information accessible to users. Using existing URLs as identifiers avoids the need to define a new identifier
scheme for resources described in opportunity data.

There will generally be a single canonical URL for a resource, e.g. the homepage for an Organization or Place, or
a public web page advertising an Event.

If there are several different URLs that may be used to identify a resource, it is recommended that systems use:

* a direct link to the resource that avoids redirects
* a stable link that will resolve to a public web page, accessible to both web browsers and applications
* a consistent link that will allow reusers to rely on the URL as an identifier, e.g. to merge in updated data

<div class="warning" title="Route Guidance property URLs in the oa: namespace
currently do not resolve. Providing resolvable definitions is a work-in-progress
to be completed 2019-08-01."></div>

This specification provides three properties for identifying resources:

* `@id` - is used to [assign a globally unique URI to a resource](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#node-identifiers). This may resolve to further machine-readable
 information about the resource, e.g. as a reference to an API endpoint. When supplied, this URI <em class="rfc2119">MUST</em> be stable and unchanging over time. Applications harvesting and
 indexing opportunity data <em class="rfc2119">SHOULD</em> use this as the unique identifier for the resource
* [schema:url](https://schema.org/url) - provides a link to a public web page about the resource. Further machine-readable metadata
<em class="rfc2119">MAY</em> be discoverable from that web page. Applications <em class="rfc2119">MUST</em> be able to use this URL as a means for providing users with a link to more information about a resource
* [schema:identifier](https://schema.org/identifier) - provides a means of sharing other identifiers for a resource, e.g. a company or registration number for an Organization, or an internal identifier for an Event. Other public identifiers can be via a [schema:PropertyValue](https://schema.org/PropertyValue). Applications <em class="rfc2119">MAY</em> use this
as a unique identifier for the resource, if there is no `@id` available.

In short, the `@id` property provides a unique global identifier, while the `schema:url` provides a means to provide a link to
a public web page about a resource.

If applicable then publishers may choose to use the same URI for these two properties. If an `@id` property is not provided then
applications <em class="rfc2119">MAY</em> choose to rely on the value of the [schema:url](https://schema.org/url) property as a unique identifier.

The option to use two different URLs is useful when there is a need to distinguish between a unique identifier and a
public resource. For example a platform hosting opportunity data may need to assign a unique identifier to a resource
that is separate to its public web page.

<pre class="example" title="Simple event description"><code>
  {
    "@context": "https://openactive.io/",
    "type": "Event",
    "id": "http://host.opportunity-data.com/id/12345",
    "url": "http://my-leisure-centre.example.org/events/1",
    "name": "Tai chi Class"
  }
</code>
</pre>

In the above example the `@id` property provides a unique identifier across
the hosting application. But the public URL for the Event uses a separate,
customer-specific domain.

## Required and Optional Properties

The following sections include more detail about the properties available to
describe each type of resource. Some properties are considered to be essential
to ensure the provision of a minimally useful set of information about each
resource. These <em class="rfc2119">REQUIRED</em> properties
<em class="rfc2119">MUST</em> be provided.

All other properties are considered to be <em class="rfc2119">OPTIONAL</em>.
Some properties have been marked as <em class="rfc2119">RECOMMENDED</em>.
Publishers <em class="rfc2119">SHOULD</em> provide these properties if it is
feasible to do so, as they will improve the quality and usability of their data.

Where data is not available to populate <em class="rfc2119">RECOMMENDED</em> and
<em class="rfc2119">OPTIONAL</em> properties, publishers
<em class="rfc2119">MUST</em> exclude these from their data. Published data
<em class="rfc2119">MUST</em> not include properties with null values, empty
strings or empty arrays.

Data publishers <em class="rfc2119">MAY</em> include additional properties,
e.g. from Schema.org or other vocabularies when helpful to describe their data.
See the section on **Extending the Model** for more information.

Applications that consume opportunity data <em class="rfc2119">MUST</em> ignore
any properties that they don't understand. This allows data publishing practices
within the sector to evolve as required.

## Controlled Vocabularies

When the value of a property might be one of a fixed set of values, it can be useful
to publish that list of values as a "controlled vocabulary".

This allows a publisher to publish the list of values, with supporting documentation
and definitions in a machine-readable format. We use the existing [[SKOS]]
standard as a means of publishing these vocabularies.

A number of properties in this data model allow data publishers to use values
from a controlled vocabulary, e.g. `oa:activity`, `oa:level`, `oa:category`, etc.

Publishers <em class="rfc2119">SHOULD</em> publish the controlled vocabularies referenced from
their data in a machine-readable format, under an open licence.

The OpenActive Community group MAY create and recommend the use of specific
controlled vocabularies to help improve the consistency of how data is published.

Publishers SHOULD use values from standard vocabularies where available.

For example, the community group is developing a controlled vocabulary that defines
a standard activity list. Values from this vocabulary can be used in the `oa:activity`
property.

The OpenActive Community Group may decide to define and recommend
some controlled vocabularies for use in these properties. At present the
values of these properties are left deliberately open to encourage publication
of open data that may inform future standardisation.

## Describing Events (<code>schema:Event</code>)

<p>
The Schema.org [schema:Event](https://schema.org/Event) type corresponds to the definition of
Event given earlier in this specification. The properties and relationships associated with the
[schema:Event](https://schema.org/Event) type can all be used to describe events.
</p>
<p>
The following table illustrates how the essential aspects of describing an event map to
existing Schema.org properties and/or properties defined in the OpenActive Vocabulary.

<p>
The following example shows a simple event description, including its start time and duration:
</p>

<pre class="example" title="Simple event description"><code>
  {
    "@context": "https://openactive.io/",
    "type": "Event",
    "url": "http://www.example.org/events/1",
    "name": "Tai chi Class",
    "description": "A tai chi class intended for beginners",
    "attendeeInstructions": "Please wear trainers and comfortable clothing",
    "startDate": "2017-03-22T20:00:00-05:00",
    "duration": "PT60M"
  }
</code>
</pre>

This basic description can be improved by providing information about its location and organizer.

<pre class="example" title="Adding a venue and an organizer"><code>
  {
    "@context": "https://openactive.io/",
    "type": "Event",
    "url": "http://www.example.org/events/1",
    "name": "Tai chi Class",
    "description": "A tai chi class intended for beginners",
    "attendeeInstructions": "Please wear trainers and comfortable clothing",
    "startDate": "2017-03-22T20:00:00-05:00",
    "duration": "PT60M",
    "organizer": [{
"type": "Organization",
"url": "http://example.org/orgs/bristol-tai-chi",
"name": "Bristol Tai Chi"
    }],
    "location": {
"type": "Place",
"name": "ExampleCo Gym",
"address": {
  "type": "PostalAddress",
  "streetAddress": "1 High Street",
  "addressLocality": "Bristol",
  "addressCountry": "GB",
  "addressRegion": "Somerset",
  "postalCode": "BS1 4SD"
}
    }
  }
</code></pre>

### Relating events to Physical Activities

<p>
The [oa:activity](https://openactive.io/activity) property allows an
event to be associated with one or more Physical Activities. The Physical
Activities used to describe an event SHOULD be drawn from a standard Activity
List, e.g. the OpenActive Activity List ([[OpenActive-Activity-List]]).
</p>

<pre class="example" title="Using activities from an Activity List"><code>
  {
    "@context": "https://openactive.io/",
    "type": "Event",
    "url": "http://www.example.org/events/1",
    "name": "Tai chi Class",
    "description": "A tai chi class intended for beginners",
    "startDate": "2017-03-22T20:00:00-05:00",
    "duration": "PT60M",
    "activity": [{
"id": "https://openactive.io/activity-list#c16df6ed-a4a0-4275-a8c3-1c8cff56856f",
"type": "Concept",
"prefLabel": "Tai Chi",
"inScheme": "https://openactive.io/activity-list"
    }]
  }
</code>
</pre>

<p>
Applications could include additional information, e.g. alternate labels for convenience of consumers.
</p>

### Describing event availability

<p>
Schema.org provides a couple of basic properties for describing the
maximum ([schema:maximumAttendeeCapacity](https://schema.org/maximumAttendeeCapacity))
and remaining capacity ([schema:remainingAttendeeCapacity](https://schema.org/remainingAttendeeCapacity)) for an [schema:Event](https://schema.org/Event).
</p>
<p>
These properties can be used to provide some basic availability information for scheduled events. These are illustrated in the following example which states that a Tai chi class can be attended by up to 20 people and that there are 4 spaces remaining.
</p>

<pre class="example" title="Basic event availability"><code>
  {
    "@context": "https://openactive.io/",
    "type": "Event",
    "url": "http://www.example.org/events/1",
    "name": "Tai chi Class",
    "description": "A tai chi class intended for beginners",
    "startDate": "2017-03-22T20:00:00-05:00",
    "duration": "PT60M",
    "maximumAttendeeCapacity": 20,
    "remainingAttendeeCapacity": 4
  }
</code>
</pre>

### Indicating the status of an event

<p>
An [schema:Event](https://schema.org/Event) may occasionally be rescheduled or cancelled. Schema.org provides the [schema:eventStatus](https://schema.org/eventStatus) property for indicating the current status of an event.
</p>

<p>
The property can have several standardised values which are defined by the [schema:EventStatusType](https://schema.org/EventStatusType) enumeration. The property values should therefore be one of the following URIs:
</p>

* Cancelled: `https://schema.org/EventCancelled`
* Postponed: `https://schema.org/EventPostponed`
* Rescheduled: `https://schema.org/EventRescheduled`
* Scheduled: `https://schema.org/EventScheduled`

<p>
If the status property is not provided then applications <em class="rfc2119">SHOULD</em> assume a default value of `https://schema.org/EventScheduled`.
</p>

<p>
The following example shows a Tai chi class that has been cancelled:
</p>

<pre class="example" title="A cancelled event"><code>
  {
    "@context": "https://openactive.io/",
    "type": "Event",
    "url": "http://www.example.org/events/1",
    "name": "Tai chi Class",
    "description": "A tai chi class intended for beginners",
    "startDate": "2017-03-22T20:00:00-05:00",
    "duration": "PT60M",
    "eventStatus": "https://schema.org/EventCancelled"
  }
</code>
</pre>

### Categorising events

<p>
The [oa:category](https://openactive.io/category) property can be
used to associate an Event with one or more tags that provide some extra
context about an event. This might include general information on the intensity
and suitability. While this property can be used to add any arbitrary tags to
an Event, a common use case is the need to tag an event as being suitable for
a specific type of audience, e.g. Beginners. Where this information is
available, the [oa:level](https://openactive.io/level) property
can be used in preference to [oa:category](https://openactive.io/category).
</p>
<p>
If an application does not distinguish between different types of tags
associated with an Event, then it <em class="rfc2119">SHOULD</em> use the
more general [oa:category](https://openactive.io/category) property.
</p>

<pre class="example" title="Tagging an Event"><code>
  {
    "@context": "https://openactive.io/",
    "type": "Event",
    "url": "http://www.example.org/events/1",
    "name": "Tai chi Class",
    "description": "A tai chi class intended for beginners",
    "startDate": "2017-03-22T20:00:00-05:00",
    "duration": "PT60M",
    "category": [
"Suitable For All", "Low Intensity"
    ],
    "level": [{
"type": "Concept",
"prefLabel": "Beginner"
    }]
  }
</code>
</pre>

<p>
Category tags can be specified as either a simple array of string values or as
Concepts. This allows publishers to include values from a controlled vocabulary if they use
one in their application.
</p>

### Adding programmes (`schema:Brand`)

Events can be associated with a Programme using the
[oa:programme](https://openactive.io/programme) property. A programme
is a [schema:Brand](https://schema.org/Brand) object.

|Property|Status|Format|Notes|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
|`@type`|REQUIRED|String|Brand|
|`@id`|RECOMMENDED|URI|A URI providing a unique identifier for the resource|
|[schema:identifier](https://schema.org/identifier)|OPTIONAL|Number, String, [schema:PropertyValue](https://schema.org/PropertyValue) or an array of [schema:PropertyValue](https://schema.org/PropertyValue)|A local identifier for the resource.|
|[schema:name](https://schema.org/name)|REQUIRED|String|The name of the programme|

### Describing the audience suitability of events

<p>
There are a variety of ways in which the suitability of an event for specific
audiences can be expressed. This includes specifying that
an event is:
</p>

* suited for a specific age range
* suited for people with specific levels of experience ([oa:level](https://openactive.io/level))
* restricted to a male, female or mixed audience

#### Age ranges

<p>
Age ranges are specified using the [oa:ageRange](https://openactive.io/ageRange) property.
The value is a [schema:QuantitativeValue](https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue)
which should have [minValue](https://schema.org/minValue) or
[maxValue](https://schema.org/maxValue) properties. These properties specify an
inclusive minimum and maximum age range for participants.
</p>

<p>
Data publishers using the [oa:ageRange](https://openactive.io/ageRange)
property MUST ensure that it has:
</p>

* a `type` of [schema:QuantitativeValue](https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue)
* at least one of the `minValue` or `maxValue`properties

<p>
Data consumers SHOULD assume that:
</p>

* if there is no `ageRange` property for an Event, then the event is suitable for adults only. E.g. as if the `minValue` has been specified as `18`
* if an `ageRange` is provided without a `minValue` property, then there is no minimum age for the `Event`
* if an `ageRange` is provided without a `maxValue` property, then there is no maximum age for the `Event`
* if an `ageRange` is provided with a `minValue` of 0, and there is no `maxValue` property then the Event is suitable for all

<p>
The following example illustrates how to specify an Event that is suitable for people aged 60 or over.
</p>

<pre class="example" title="Age range example"><code>
  {
    "@context": "https://openactive.io/",
    "type": "Event",
    "url": "http://www.example.org/events/1",
    "name": "Tai chi Class",
    "ageRange": {
 "type": "QuantitativeValue",
 "minValue": 60
    }
  }
</code>
</pre>

<p>
The following example illustrates an Event that is suitable for all ages.
This is indicated by providing an `minValue` property with a value of zero and
no `maxValue` property.
</p>

<pre class="example" title="Age range - suitable for all example"><code>
  {
    "@context": "https://openactive.io/",
    "type": "Event",
    "url": "http://www.example.org/events/1",
    "name": "Exercise in the park",
    "ageRange": {
 "type": "QuantitativeValue",
 "minValue": 0
    }
  }
</code>
</pre>

#### Gender restrictions

<p>
Attendance at some events is limited to certain audiences. For example a
female only gym class. The [oa:genderRestriction](https://openactive.io/genderRestriction)
property can be used to specify these restrictions.
</p>

<p>
Data publishers using this property MUST use one of the following values:
</p>

* `https://openactive.io/NoRestriction` indicating that the event has no restrictions
* `https://openactive.io/MaleOnly` indicating that the event is restricted to the male gender
* `https://openactive.io/FemaleOnly` indicating that the event is restricted to the female gender

<p>
If the `genderRestriction` property is not supplied for an Event, then data
consumers SHOULD NOT assume a default value, the value should be treated as
`null`. When searching or filtering for gender restricted Events, data
consumers SHOULD remove Events with a `null` value.
</p>

<p>
Invalid values for the `genderRestriction` property SHOULD be treated as `null`.
</p>

<pre class="example" title="Gender restriction example"><code>
  {
    "@context": "https://openactive.io/",
    "type": "Event",
    "url": "http://www.example.org/events/1",
    "name": "Gym class",
    "genderRestriction": "https://openactive.io/FemaleOnly"
  }
</code>
</pre>

<div class="note" title="Request for feedback">
<p>The community group is aware of both the issues that arise from defining
standard terms for gender and the inclusivity issues that might arise from
restricting participation in events.</p>

<p>We have standardised these terms to reflect the ways that events are currently
described. However there are many additional considerations that relate to how
gender is described and the ways that events might be advertised and run in order
for people to feel safe and included.</p>
<p>
We encourage the community to reflect on the approach outlined here and experiment
with alternative options. We have <a href="https://github.com/openactive/modelling-opportunity-data/issues/69#issuecomment-401336335"> outlined some of these options</a> and welcome feedback on how we can improve this area of the specification.
</p>
</div>

#### Describing support for disabilities

<p>
This specification defines several ways to capture information from organisers
about the types of support they provide for people with disabilities or
other impairments. This includes:
</p>

* listing the types of disability or impairment that are, or can be accommodated at an event using the [oa:accessibilitySupport](https://openactive.io/accessibilitySupport) property
* providing additional notes for participants using the [oa:accessibilityInformation](https://openactive.io/accessibilityInformation) property

<p>
Examples of using these are shown below:
</p>

<pre class="example" title="Accessibility information"><code>
  {
    "@context": "https://openactive.io/",
    "type": "Event",
    "url": "http://www.example.org/events/1",
    "name": "Tai chi Class",
    "description": "A tai chi class intended for beginners",
    "startDate": "2017-03-22T20:00:00-05:00",
    "duration": "PT60M",
    "accessibilitySupport": ["Hearing Impairment", "Visual Impairment"],
    "accessibilityInformation": "The location is fully accessible, please contact the organiser if you have questions"
  }
</code>
</pre>

### Parent-child relationships between Events

Events are often related to one another in parent-child relationships. For
example a whole day event (the parent) might consist of a programme of
shorter events such as individual races that take place at
different times of the day (the children).

This type of relationship between events can be described using the
[schema:subEvent](https://schema.org/subEvent) and [schema:superEvent](https://schema.org/superEvent)
properties. Note on each occasion within this specification that a relationship is
represented using [schema:subEvent](https://schema.org/subEvent), the inverse is also
possible using [schema:superEvent](https://schema.org/superEvent) and conformance rules MUST be adapted accordingly.

<pre class="example" title="Parent-child Events"><code>
  {
    "@context": "https://openactive.io/",
    "type": "HeadlineEvent",
    "url": "http://www.example.org/events/1",
    "name": "Aquathlon Day",
    "description": "A day of aquathlon races",
    "startDate": "2018-09-01T09:00:00-05:00",
    "endDate": "2018-09-01T17:00:00-05:00",
    "duration": "P1D",
    "subEvent": [
{
  "type": "Event",
  "url": "http://www.example.org/events/2",
  "name": "Aquathlon Sprint",
  "startDate": "2018-09-01T10:00:00-05:00"
},
{
  "type": "Event",
  "url": "http://www.example.org/events/2",
  "name": "Aquathlon Long Course",
  "startDate": "2018-09-01T14:00:00-05:00"
}
    ]
  }
</code>
</pre>

The `HeadlineEvent` type used in this example is described in the following
section.

When not otherwise specified on the child event, a consumer MAY assume that
some properties that describe the parent (`schema:superEvent`) event also
apply to the child. This might include properties such as the location,
organizer or audience suitability of an Event. This is referred to as "__property inheritance__".

Some properties are never inherited. These properties are `@type`, `@id`, `schema:url`,
`schema:identifier` and `schema:eventSchedule`. A consumer MUST NOT assume that
these properties apply to child events.

If a child Event provides a property with the same name as its parent
(e.g. `startDate`) then consumers MUST use the value provided for the child and
not that of the parent.

By default the `offers` property, listing the Offers available to participate in
an Event are also not inherited. Consumers MUST NOT assume that any Offers
provided for a parent event are automatically applicable to child events. However
some types of event MAY allow for inheritance of offers. This is discussed in the
following sections.

### Types of event

[schema:Event](https://schema.org/Event) provides a useful default type for
describing Events.

However in practice it can be useful to distinguish between some specific types
of Event. This gives data consumers more context that can help them index and
recommended Events to potential participants. Recognising additional types of
Event can also be useful in defining additional conformance and validation
rules that guide how data is published and used.

This specification defines several sub-types of Event. These are described in
the following sections. Unless otherwise specified:

* all of the properties defined for [schema:Event](https://schema.org/Event)
can applied to each sub-type
* properties have the same status (e.g. REQUIRED) as for the generic type
* the property inheritance rules defined in the previous section apply to each
sub-type

Where publishers are unsure whether a sub-type applies they SHOULD use the
generic [schema:Event](https://schema.org/Event) type. Publishers MUST NOT use
any of these sub-types to describe other forms of Event.

When data consumers encounter a new sub-type of Event, they SHOULD treat it as if
it were of the generic [schema:Event](https://schema.org/Event) type. New sub-types
might be defined in future versions of this specification or as custom types by
individual publishers.

#### Regular sessions (`SessionSeries` and `ScheduledSession`)

Many organisers run regularly scheduled Events, e.g. a weekly exercise class or
a monthly ride of a cycle club.

These can be thought of as two distinct types of Event:

* [oa:SessionSeries](https://openactive.io/SessionSeries) - the overall series of events, e.g. Wednesday Yoga
* [oa:ScheduledSession](https://openactive.io/ScheduledSession) - the individual sessions, e.g. Wednesday Yoga
on 5th September 2018

The following example illustrates how these types are used.

<pre class="example" title="Scheduled Series"><code>
  {
    "@context": "https://openactive.io/",
    "type": "SessionSeries",
    "url": "http://www.example.org/events/1",
    "name": "Wednesday Yoga",
    "description": "Yoga on a Wednesday",
    "startDate": "2018-01-01",
    "endDate": "2018-12-31"
    "subEvent": [
{
  "type": "ScheduledSession",
  "url": "http://www.example.org/events/2",
  "startDate": "2018-09-05T18:00:00-05:00",
  "endDate": "2018-09-05T19:00:00-05:00",
  "duration": "PT1H"
},
...
    ]
  }
</code>
</pre>

Publishers SHOULD use the [oa:SessionSeries](https://openactive.io/SessionSeries) type for describing Events that
occur on a regular schedule. The child events of
a [oa:SessionSeries](https://openactive.io/SessionSeries) provided in a [schema:subEvent](https://schema.org/subEvent) property MUST all be
of the [oa:ScheduledSession](https://openactive.io/ScheduledSession) type.

As an [oa:SessionSeries](https://openactive.io/SessionSeries) is intended to be
a parent for other events, then it MUST have either a [schema:eventSchedule](https://pending.schema.org/eventSchedule) which
describes the schedule for the subevents, OR must be explicitly associated with
those events via a [schema:subEvent](https://schema.org/subEvent) (or [schema:superEvent](https://schema.org/superEvent))
property.

Where an [schema:eventSchedule](https://pending.schema.org/eventSchedule) is provided for
a [oa:SessionSeries](https://openactive.io/SessionSeries) then it MUST include a
[oa:scheduledEventType](https://openactive.io/scheduledEventType) property with a value
of [oa:ScheduledSession](https://openactive.io/ScheduledSession)

In addition to the above, there are some other changes that apply to these type
that override conformance rules defined for [schema:Event](https://schema.org/Event).

For an [oa:ScheduledSession](https://openactive.io/ScheduledSession):

* it MUST NOT have either a [schema:eventSchedule](https://pending.schema.org/eventSchedule) or a [schema:subEvent](https://schema.org/subEvent). They are individual instances
of events.
* the `schema:startDate` property is REQUIRED. This will either be explicitly provided or derived as part of generating it
from a `Schedule`
* The `schema:url` property is RECOMMENDED
* The `schema:eventStatus` property is RECOMMENDED
* The `schema:description`, `schema:image`, `schema:organizer`, `oa:ageRange`, `oa:genderRestriction` and `oa:level` properties
are OPTIONAL. This information can be provided and inherited from the parent `oa:SessionSeries`

For an [oa:SessionSeries](https://openactive.io/SessionSeries):

* it MUST NOT have a [schema:remainingAttendeeCapacity](https://schema.org/remainingAttendeeCapacity). They are a series of sessions so do not have capacity themselves.
* The `schema:maximumAttendeeCapacity` property is OPTIONAL
* The `schema:startDate` and `schema:endDate` properties are OPTIONAL
* The `schema:eventStatus` property is OPTIONAL

In addition to the normal rules around property inheritance, data consumers
MAY also assume that Offers provided for a [oa:SessionSeries](https://openactive.io/SessionSeries) also apply to
their child events, of type [oa:ScheduledSession](https://openactive.io/ScheduledSession).

This is in the only time that Offers may be inherited between types. This is
permitted here as the parent Event exists to describe a series of sessions. The
individual sessions MAY have additional properties and consumers MUST use these
where provided.

#### Headline events (`HeadlineEvent`)

The ability to describe parent-child relationships between Events provides a
useful way to publish an event programme for a whole day or multi-day event,
such as a mass participation event, family fun day, etc.

To help distinguish programmed events from the "headline" event itself, this
specification defines the [oa:HeadlineEvent](https://openactive.io/HeadlineEvent)
type.

<pre class="example" title="Headline Events"><code>
  {
    "@context": "https://openactive.io/",
    "type": "HeadlineEvent",
    "url": "http://www.example.org/events/1",
    "name": "Aquathlon Day",
    "description": "A day of aquathlon races",
    "startDate": "2018-09-01T09:00:00-05:00",
    "endDate": "2018-09-01T17:00:00-05:00",
    "duration": "P1D",
    "subEvent": [
{
  "type": "Event",
  "url": "http://www.example.org/events/2",
  "name": "Aquathlon Sprint",
  "startDate": "2018-09-01T10:00:00-05:00"
},
{
  "type": "Event",
  "url": "http://www.example.org/events/3",
  "name": "Aquathlon Long Course",
  "startDate": "2018-09-01T14:00:00-05:00"
}
    ]
  }
</code>
</pre>

The [oa:HeadlineEvent](https://openactive.io/HeadlineEvent) is mainly
provided as a means for data consumers to treat these types of events differently
from [oa:SessionSeries](https://openactive.io/HeadlineEvent).

For example a web application might display a
[oa:HeadlineEvent](https://openactive.io/HeadlineEvent) with a custom page
that includes a summary of its programme of activities.

A [oa:HeadlineEvent](https://openactive.io/HeadlineEvent) is an event in
its own right, and MUST NOT have an `schema:eventSchedule` property. Publishers
MUST provide a `schema:startDate`.

As with the generic type, any Offers provided for a
[oa:HeadlineEvent](https://openactive.io/HeadlineEvent) apply to that
Event, they are not inherited by individual child events. However a publisher
MAY provide Offers for individual events in the programme if they are individually
ticketed.

#### Courses (`CourseInstance`)

Schema.org defines a [Course](https://pending.schema.org/Course) as an education
course that is run at different times and places. The course might consist of one or
more individual classes.

These instances of a course are described using the
[schema:CourseInstance](https://pending.schema.org/CourseInstance) type.

Publishers SHOULD use the [schema:CourseInstance](https://pending.schema.org/CourseInstance)
type when describing courses of any duration.

<pre class="example" title="Course Instance"><code>
  {
    "@context": "https://openactive.io/",
    "type": "CourseInstance",
    "url": "http://www.example.org/events/1",
    "name": "Sailing Course",
    "description": "A ten week sailing course",
    "startDate": "2018-08-30",
    "endDate": "2018-11-08"
    "subEvent": [
{
  "type": "Event",
  "url": "http://www.example.org/events/2",
  "startDate": "2018-08-30T09:00:00-05:00",
  "endDate": "2018-08-30T10:00:00-05:00",
  "duration": "PT1H"
},
...
    ]
  }
</code>
</pre>

A [schema:CourseInstance](https://pending.schema.org/CourseInstance) MUST have
either a `subEvent` property AND/or an `eventSchedule` property that provides
information about the individual classes.

Child events of a [schema:CourseInstance](https://pending.schema.org/CourseInstance)
SHOULD be of the generic `schema:Event` type.

A participant will typically pay to attend a whole course. So, as with the
generic type, any Offers provided for a [[schema:CourseInstance](https://pending.schema.org/CourseInstance)
apply to the whole course any not the individual classes. However a publisher
MAY provide Offers for individual events in the programme if they are individually
ticketed.

<div class="note" title="Status of CourseInstance">
[schema:CourseInstance](https://pending.schema.org/CourseInstance) is currently
a draft Schema.org type. As a result, both publishers and consumers should be aware
that its definition may need to change in future versions of this specification.
</div>

#### Grouping together events (`EventSeries`)

All of the previous examples of event types provide a means of grouping together
events:

* `schema:CourseInstance` defines a group of classes
* `oa:SessionSeries` groups together a series of regular events
* `oa:HeadlineEvent` groups together a programme events occuring as part of a large
Event

More broadly, other properties of a set of Events can be used to group them together
in useful ways. For example Events might be grouped based on:

* their `schema:organizer` to identify all Events organisations by a specific
person or organisation
* their `schema:place` to list all Events taking place at a specific location
* their `oa:programmee` to identify Events that are part of the same Brand
* their `oa:activity` to define a list of Events that involve the same physical
activity

Data consumers are encouraged to use all of the information available about Events
to provide useful ways for participants to discover opportunities to be active.
Data publishers should expect that events published as open data might be
organised and presented in a number of different ways.

However it can also be useful for publishers to identify that a set of Events are
related to one another in some way and provide information about that set.

The Schema.org [EventSeries](https://pending.schema.org/EventSeries) type can
be used to group together related events. This allows the publisher to provide
this grouping for data consumers, along with additional information such as
images, a common description, etc.

The following example illustrates using this type to group together adult swimming
sessions available from two different locations at different dates and times.
Event schedules are described further in the following section.

<pre class="example" title="Event Series"><code>
  {
    "@context": "https://openactive.io/",
    "type": "EventSeries",
    "url": "http://www.example.org/events/1",
    "name": "Swim For Adults",
    "description": "Adult swimming session",
    "activity": [{
    "type": "Concept",
    "prefLabel": "Swimming"
    }],
    "subEvent": [
{
  "type": "SessionSeries",
  "url": "http://www.example.org/events/2",
  "name": "Swim For Adults",
  "location": {
    "type": "Place",
    "name": "ExampleCo Gym"
    ...
  },
  "eventSchedule": [
    {
"type": "Schedule",
"startDate": "2017-01-01",
"endDate": "2017-12-31",
"repeatFrequency": "P1W",
"byDay": [ "https://schema.org/Wednesday" ],
"startTime": "19:00",
"endTime": "20:00",
"duration": "PT1H",
"scheduledEventType": "ScheduledSession"
    }
  ]
},
{
  "type": "SessionSeries",
  "url": "http://www.example.org/events/2",
  "name": "Swim For Adults",
  "location": {
    "type": "Place",
    "name": "A. N. Other Gym"
    ...
  },
  "eventSchedule": [
    {
"type": "Schedule",
"startDate": "2017-01-01",
"endDate": "2017-12-31",
"repeatFrequency": "P1W",
"byDay": [ "https://schema.org/Thursday" ],
"startTime": "18:00",
"endTime": "20:00",
"duration": "PT2H",
"scheduledEventType": "ScheduledSession"
    }
  ]
}
    ]
  }
</code>
</pre>

The [schema:EventSeries](https://pending.schema.org/EventSeries) type can be used
as a parent for any type of event, including the generic [schema:Event](https://www.schema.org/Event)
type.

The `schema:location`, `schema:startDate` and `schema:endDate` propertes are
only RECOMMENDED.

<div class="note" title="Grouping CourseInstance">
We note however that when grouping together [schema:CourseInstance](https://pending.schema.org/CourseInstance)
events, it may be more appropriate to describe associate them with a
[schema:Course](https://schema.org/Course). Although unlike [schema:EventSeries](https://pending.schema.org/EventSeries)
this is not a type of event.
</div>

<div class="note" title="Status of EventSeries">
[schema:EventSeries](https://pending.schema.org/EventSeries) is currently
a draft Schema.org type. As a result, both publishers and consumers should be aware
that its definition may need to change in future versions of this specification.
</div>

### Publishing event schedules

<div class="note" title="Schema.org support for recurring events">
<p>
This specification relies on some pending changes to Schema.org that will add recurrence rules to Events. The [proposal](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/pull/1693) has been accepted, but is not yet formally part of the model.
</p>
<p>We expect that this proposal will become part of Schema.org in due course. This process will be driven by implementation experience and feedback from the community. On that basis we have included the terms in specification. The following section is written on that basis. However both publishers and consumers should be aware that this is an area that may change in future versions.</p>
</div>

The previous section has described several methods for publishing lists of upcoming
events, e.g. an `oa:SessionSeries` with a list of its upcoming `oa:ScheduledSession`,
or a [schema:EventSeries](https://pending.schema.org/EventSeries) and a list of
Events.

Using the `schema:subEvent` property in this way allows a publisher to publish
a calendar of forthcoming events. This can also be useful when there may be minor variations
in the details of each Event. For example an alternate location, time, etc.

However when Events occur to a precise schedule, it can be useful to publish
information about the schedule itself rather than listing each individual event.
Describing the schedule means publishing less data as data consumers will be
able to calculate when a future event will take place.

The [schema:eventSchedule](https://pending.schema.org/eventSchedule) property can
be used to associate a [`schema:Event`] (or one of its sub-types) with a
[schema:Schedule](https://pending.schema.org/Schedule).

Based on the [iCalendar](https://icalendar.org/) specification, a
[schema:Schedule](https://pending.schema.org/Schedule) define a repeating
calendar entry. A data consumer can apply these rules to generate future instances
of an event, e.g. to populate a calendar

|Property|Status|Format|Notes|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
|`@type`|REQUIRED|String|`Schedule`|
|[schema:repeatFrequency](https://pending.schema.org/repeatFrequency)|REQUIRED|String|The frequency of the events, specified as an [[ISO8601]] duration, e.g. day, week, month|
|[schema:startDate](https://schema.org/startDate)|RECOMMENDED|String|Specifies the [schema:Date](https://schema.org/Date) from which the schedule is active|
|[schema:endDate](https://schema.org/startDate)|RECOMMENDED|String|Specifies the [schema:Date](https://schema.org/Date) at which the schedule ends.|
|[schema:startTime](https://schema.org/startTime)|REQUIRED|String|Specifies the [schema:Time](https://schema.org/Time) at which the Events will take place.|
|[schema:endTime](https://schema.org/endTime)|REQUIRED|String|Specifies the [schema:Time](https://schema.org/Time) at which the Events will end|
|[schema:duration](https://schema.org/duration)|RECOMMENDED|String|Specifies the duration of the Event as an [[ISO8601]] duration.  Durations MUST NOT be zero length. If duration is unknown it should be omitted.  A duration MUST be provided if both a start and end date are available.|
|[schema:byDay](https://pending.schema.org/byDay)|OPTIONAL|Array of [schema:DayOfWeek](https://schema.org/DayOfWeek) or Array of String|Lists the day(s) of the week during which the Events will take place. When using string values, this MUST conform to iCal BYDAY rule.|
|[schema:byMonth](https://pending.schema.org/byMonth)|OPTIONAL|Array of Integers|Lists the month(s) of the year during which the Events will take place. January is the first month|
|[schema:byMonthDay](https://pending.schema.org/byMonthDay)|OPTIONAL|Array of Integers|Lists the day(s) of the month on which an Event will take place|
|[schema:repeatCount](https://pending.schema.org/repeatCount)|OPTIONAL|Number|Specifies that an Event will repeat the specified number of times|
|[schema:exceptDate](https://pending.schema.org/exceptDate)|OPTIONAL|Array of [Date](https://schema.org/Date) or [DateTime](https://schema.org/DateTime)|Defines a list of [Date](https://schema.org/Date) or [DateTime](https://schema.org/DateTime) during which a scheduled Event will not take place. The property allows exceptions to a Schedule to be specified. If an exception is specified as a [DateTime](https://schema.org/DateTime) then only the event that would have started at that specific date and time should be excluded from the schedule. If an exception is specified as a [Date](https://schema.org/Date) then any event that is scheduled for that 24 hour period should be excluded from the schedule. This allows a whole day to be excluded from the schedule without having to itemise every scheduled event.|
|[oa:scheduledEventType](https://openactive.io/scheduledEventType)|REQUIRED|String|Specifies the type that a data consumer should assign to Events that are generated from this schedule.|
|[oa:urlTemplate](https://openactive.io/urlTemplate)|RECOMMENDED|String|An [[RFC6570]] compliant URI template that can be used to generate a unique URL (`schema:url`) for every event described by the schedule (see below for more information). This property is REQUIRED if the data provider wants to provide participants with a unique URL to book to attend an event.|
|[oa:idTemplate](https://openactive.io/idTemplate)|RECOMMENDED|String|An [[RFC6570]] compliant URI template that can be used to generate a unique identifier (`@id`) for every event described by the schedule (see below for more information). This property is REQUIRED if the data provider is supporting third-party booking via the [[Open-Booking-API]].|

A [schema:Schedule](https://pending.schema.org/Schedule) is defined as having a number of required fields that will support the creation of events from the schedule it describes. As a minimum a data user will need to be provided with:

* the [schema:repeatFrequency](https://schema.org/repeatFrequency) at
which the events will occur
* a [schema:startTime](https://schema.org/startTime) and [schema:endTime](https://schema.org/endTime)
properties to indicate when the events will take place
* the [`oa:scheduledEventType`] that will indicate the type of Event that this schedule generates. This is important to ensure
that data consumers can properly apply rules for parent-child relationships between
events

While marked as optional, publishers also need to provide additional information about the frequency, e.g. whether the event occurs on a specific day, day of the month, or month, by including one of the [schema:byDay](https://pending.schema.org/byDay), [schema:byMonth](https://pending.schema.org/byMonth) or [schema:byMonthDay](https://pending.schema.org/byMonthDay) properties

For Events that are intended to be bookable then publishers SHOULD also provide
the [oa:idTemplate](https://openactive.io/idTemplate) and [oa:urlTemplate](https://openactive.io/urlTemplate) properties.

In practice we recommend that publishers provide as much detail in possible to allow data consumers to reliably expand a schedule into a calendar of events.

The following example illustrates basic usage of the [schema:eventSchedule](https://pending.schema.org/eventSchedule) property to associate an `Event` with a [schema:Schedule](https://pending.schema.org/Schedule). The data describes a Tai Chi class that occurs every Wednesday at 7pm

<pre class="example" title="Adding an event schedule"><code>
  {
    "@context": "https://openactive.io/",
    "type": "SessionSeries",
    "url": "http://www.example.org/events/1",
    "name": "Tai chi Class",
    "description": "A tai chi class intended for beginners",
    "duration": "PT60M",
    "eventSchedule": [
{
  "type": "Schedule",
  "startDate": "2017-01-01",
  "endDate": "2017-12-31",
  "repeatFrequency": "P1W",
  "byDay": [ "https://schema.org/Wednesday" ],
  "startTime": "19:00",
  "endTime": "20:00",
  "duration": "PT1H",
  "scheduledEventType": "ScheduledSession"
}
    ]
  }
</code>
</pre>

#### Partial schedules

There are cases when a system may only capture partial information about event
scheduling from its organizers, e.g. only that an event will run every Wednesday
but not its specific timing. Perhaps because these may
vary or the organizer needs to regularly confirm that events will actually run.

While information on partial schedules can be provided as text via
the [oa:schedulingNote](https://openactive.io/schedulingNote) property, it
would be useful to have this in machine readable format where possible.

To support this publishers SHOULD use the [oa:PartialSchedule](https://openactive.io/PartialSchedule) type
for publishing partially defined schedules. This type is identical to `schema:Schedule` but has no
required properties.

Publishers providing a [oa:PartialSchedule](https://openactive.io/PartialSchedule) MUST provide information on
the actual events as they are confirmed via the [subEvent](https://schema.org/subEvent) property.

Publishers that are able to provide the required detail for a more complete
`schema:Schedule` SHOULD use that instead.

<div class="note">
In cases where a [oa:PartialSchedule](https://openactive.io/PartialSchedule) includes
enough information to generate a forthcoming calendar of events, then data consumers
should consider how to present this information in a way that will make it clear
to end users that the event details may be subject to change.
</div>

#### Generating URLs and identifiers for scheduled events

This specification uses the `schema:url` property to provide participants with
deep links into websites and booking systems. It is a REQUIRED property for
every Event.

The `@id` property of an Event provides a unique stable identifier for an Event.
It is a RECOMMENDED property that, as described in the [[Open-Booking-API]], MAY provide an entry point
into an API that allows retrieval of current information about an Event and a
means to carry out third-party bookings.

A data consumer therefore needs a reliable way to generate `schema:url` and `@id`
properties for individual Events in a schedule. To achieve these we rely on URL
templates defined in [[RFC6570]].

The [oa:idTemplate](https://openactive.io/idTemplate) and
[oa:urlTemplate](https://openactive.io/urlTemplate) properties of
a [schema:Schedule](https://pending.schema.org/Schedule) provide URL templates
that can be expanded out into the appropriate `@id` and `schema:url` property values.

To apply these templates correctly, data consumers MUST support Level 1 (simple
variable substitution) of [[RFC6570]]. Only two variables need to be substitutable
into the templates: `startDate` and `endDate`.

Publishers MUST ensure that values for these properties are valid according to
the Level 1 processing rules for [[RFC6570]]. Publishers MUST NOT use additional
syntax or substitution rules from [RFC6570]].

To convert a `Schedule` into an instance of an `Event` a data consumer MUST therefore
do the following:

1. Generate an Event object with a `@type` property that matches the value of the `schema:scheduledEventType`
provided in the `Schedule`
2. Use the rules defined in the `Schedule` to calculate the `schema:startDate` and `schema:endDate` of
the next event and assign these to the new Event object
3. Take the `oa:idTemplate` property (if provided) and subsitute the `startDate` variable with the
calculated value of `schema:startDate`. Do the same for `endDate` and `schema:endDate`. Use the resulting
string as the value of the `@id` property for the event
4. Take the `oa:urlTemplate` property (if provided) and subsitute the `startDate` variable with the
calculated value of `schema:startDate`. Do the same for `endDate` and `schema:endDate`. Use the resulting
string as the value of the `schema:url` property for the event

Other than complying with [[RFC6570]] publishers are free to provide additional
information in their URL templates to ensure that identifiers and URLs are unique.
For example by including the `identifier` for the parent event.

Publishers MAY use templated that generate URIs that result in redirects.
Data consumers SHOULD be prepared to follow redirects from generated `schema:url` or `@id` properties.

#### Providing status updates for scheduled events

In the section on [Indicating the status of an event](#indicating-the-status-of-an-event)
we note that events are sometimes cancelled, rescheduled or postponed. It is important
that data publishers provide status updates on events as a data consumer may need
to notify a user of changes.

When a publisher is providing a [schema:Schedule](https://pending.schema.org/Schedule) for upcoming events rather than
an explicit list of upcoming events, a data consumer needs to be able to identify
when an upcoming event has had a status change.

To handle this we recommend that publishers SHOULD provide details of the updated event:

* via their RPDE feed(s), allowing all consumers to receive updates on the status of an individual events
* via an API, e.g. as described in the [[Open-Booking-API]], allowing
authorised data consumers to confirm the event status during booking, or to receive
notifications of changes

For cancelled Events, publishers SHOULD NOT just amend a `Schedule` to add a new
`schema:exceptDate` that removes the event from the schedule.

For data consumers to be able to associate an updated event description with a
event they have generated from a [schema:Schedule](https://pending.schema.org/Schedule)
a publisher MUST use the same identifier (`@id`) for the event as a consumer may
have generated from an [oa:idTemplate](https://openactive.io/idTemplate)
provided in the schedule.

If no [oa:idTemplate](https://openactive.io/idTemplate) was
provided then consumers do not have a reliable means to determine status changes.
They MAY attempt to use other means, e.g. matching based on date, time, location, etc.

## Describing Locations (<code>schema:Place</code>)

This specification recommends use of the [schema:Place](https://schema.org/Place)
and [schema:SportsActivityLocation](https://schema.org/SportsActivityLocation)
types for describing locations.

The [schema:location](https://schema.org/location) property can be used to
relate an [schema:Event](https://schema.org/Event)
or [oa:FacilityUse](https://openactive.io/FacilityUse) to a Place.

The following table lists a number of properties that can be used to
describe a [schema:Place](https://schema.org/Place).

|Property|Status|Format|Notes|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
|`@type`|REQUIRED|String|A type of Place as defined by Schema.org|
|`@id`|RECOMMENDED|URI|A URI providing a unique identifier for the resource|

Where possible publishers MUST specify an address as an object. Publishers MUST only use a String value if all have is a generic location name, e.g. "In Victoria Park, near the lake"|
|[schema:geo](https://schema.org/geo)|RECOMMENDED|[schema:GeoCoordinates](https://schema.org/GeoCoordinates)|The geographic co-ordinates, specified as a latitude and longitude of a Place|
|[schema:containedInPlace](https://schema.org/containedInPlace)|OPTIONAL|[schema:Place](https://schema.org/Place)|Indicates that this Place is part of a larger location. Can be used to allow, e.g. a pitch or other facility to be related to a parent location such as a Leisure Centre|
|[schema:containsPlace](https://schema.org/containsPlace)|OPTIONAL|Array of [schema:Place](https://schema.org/Place)|Relates a Place to one or more other locations and facilities that it contains.|
|[schema:telephone](https://schema.org/telephone)|RECOMMENDED|String|A contact telephone number for the location, e.g. for enquiries|

The value of this property will be an array of [schema:LocationFeatureSpecification](https://schema.org/LocationFeatureSpecification) objects. See "Describing Amenities" for more information.|


The following example illustrates a simple place description including its name, address, telephone number and website.

<pre class="example" title="Describing a leisure centre"><code>
  {
    "@context": "https://openactive.io/",
    "type": "Place",
    "url": "http://www.better.org.uk/leisure-centre/banes/bath-sports-and-leisure-centre",
    "name": "Bath Sports and Leisure Centre",
    "address": {
  "type": "PostalAddress",
  "streetAddress": "North Parade Road",
  "addressLocality": "Bath",
  "addressRegion": "Somerset",
  "postalCode": "BA2 4ET",
  "addressCountry": "GB"
    },
    "telephone": "+44 (0)1225 486905"
  }
</code></pre>

### Describing Addresses

Schema.org provides the following properties for publishing address data using the [schema:PostalAddress](https://schema.org/PostalAddress) type.

|Property|Status|Format|Notes|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
|`@type`|REQUIRED|String|PostalAddress|
|[schema:streetAddress](https://schema.org/streetAddress)|REQUIRED|String|Street address|
|[schema:addressLocality](https://schema.org/addressLocality)|REQUIRED|String|Town or other area|
|[schema:addressRegion](https://schema.org/addressRegion)|REQUIRED|String|Region|
|[schema:postalCode](https://schema.org/postalCode)|REQUIRED|String|Postcode|
|[schema:addressCountry](https://schema.org/addressCountry)|REQUIRED|String|ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code|

The following example shows how to markup a simple address:

<pre class="example" title="An Address"><code>
  {
    "@context": "https://openactive.io/",
    "type": "PostalAddress",
    "streetAddress": "North Parade Road",
    "addressLocality": "Bath",
    "addressRegion": "Somerset",
    "postalCode": "BA2 4ET",
    "addressCountry": "GB"
  }
</code></pre>

### Describing Geographic Location

A more precise geographical location can be provided for a [schema:Place](https://schema.org/Place) by adding a [schema:geo](https://schema.org/geo) property. The value of this property is a is a [schema:GeoCoordinates](https://schema.org/GeoCoordinates) object.

|Property|Status|Format|Notes|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
|`@type`|REQUIRED|String|`GeoCoordinates`|
|[schema:latitude](https://schema.org/latitude)|REQUIRED|Number|Latitude|
|[schema:longitude](https://schema.org/longitude)|REQUIRED|Number|Longitude|

Latitude and longitude values SHOULD be provided to a precision of at least
two decimal places in order to be useful to consumers.

The following example illustrates how to use the
[schema:geo](https://schema.org/geo) property.

<pre class="example" title="Locating a leisure centre"><code>
  {
    "@context": "https://openactive.io/",
    "type": "Place",
    "url": "http://www.better.org.uk/leisure-centre/banes/bath-sports-and-leisure-centre",
    "name": "Bath Sports and Leisure Centre",
    "address": {
  "type": "PostalAddress",
  "streetAddress": "North Parade Road",
  "addressLocality": "Bath",
  "addressRegion": "Somerset",
  "postalCode": "BA2 4ET",
  "addressCountry": "GB"
    },
    "telephone": "+44 (0)1225 486905",
    "geo": {
"type": "GeoCoordinates",
"latitude": 51.3816123,
"longitude": -2.3544367
    }
  }
</code></pre>

### Describing Amenities

It can be useful to describe the amenities (e.g. characteristics, services or other features) available at a location.

Schema.org provides the [schema:amenityFeature](https://schema.org/amenityFeature) property for specifying an list of amenities that are available or unavailable at a specific [schema:Place](https://schema.org/Place). The value of a the property is an array of objects that describe the individual amenities.

To improve consistency in how amenities are published, this specification defines some common types of amenities:

* [ChangingFacilities](https://openactive.io/ChangingFacilities)
* [Showers](https://openactive.io/Showers)
* [Toilets](https://openactive.io/Toilets)
* [Lockers](https://openactive.io/Lockers)
* [Towels](https://openactive.io/Towels)
* [Creche](https://openactive.io/Creche)
* [Parking](https://openactive.io/Parking)
* [BabyChanging](https://openactive.io/BabyChanging)

Publishers SHOULD use one of these types when applicable. If there is no pre-defined type then data publishers MUST use the more generic [schema:LocationFeatureSpecification](https://schema.org/LocationFeatureSpecification) type.

This avoids the need for data consumers to have to rely on the `name` value to identify common amenities that may otherwise be named differently (e.g. "Changing Rooms, "Changing Facilities", etc).

<pre class="example" title="Amenity example"><code>
  {
    "@context": "https://openactive.io/",
    "type": "Place",
    "amenityFeature": [
 {
    "type": "ChangingFacilities",
    "name": "Changing Facilities",
    "value": true
 }
    ]
  }
</code></pre>

Publishers MUST include the `type`, `name` and `value` properties for each amenity. A `value` of `false` indicates that a specific amenity is not available.

Additional information MAY be provided about each of the amenities, using properties from the [schema:LocationFeatureSpecification](https://schema.org/LocationFeatureSpecification) type. For example, specifying opening hours ([schema:hoursAvailable](https://schema.org/hoursAvailable)) or to add a description ([schema:description](https://schema.org/description)).

The list of pre-defined amenties MAY be revised in future specifications based on feedback from the community.

In the meantime additional types of amenities can be specified using the more generic [schema:LocationFeatureSpecification](https://schema.org/LocationFeatureSpecification) type as shown below:

<pre class="example" title="Generic amenity type example"><code>
  {
    "@context": "https://openactive.io/",
    "type": "Place",
    "amenityFeature": [
 {
    "type": "LocationFeatureSpecification",
    "name": "Outdoor seating",
    "value": true
 }
    ]
  }
</code></pre>


### Describing Facilities at a Location

Facilities such as swimming pools, courts, etc available at a location can
be expressed using the containment properties
([schema:containedInPlace](https://schema.org/containedInPlace)
and [schema:containsPlace](https://schema.org/containsPlace)). The following example illustrates how to describe that a Leisure Centre includes a gym:

<pre class="example" title="Describing a leisure centre"><code>
  {
    "@context": "https://openactive.io/",
    "type": "Place",
    "url": "http://www.better.org.uk/leisure-centre/banes/bath-sports-and-leisure-centre",
    "name": "Bath Sports and Leisure Centre",
    "address": {
  "type": "PostalAddress",
  "streetAddress": "North Parade Road",
  "addressLocality": "Bath",
  "addressRegion": "Somerset",
  "postalCode": "BA2 4ET",
  "addressCountry": "GB"
    },
    "containsPlace": [{
"type": "SportsActivityLocation",
"url": "http://www.better.org.uk/leisure-centre/banes/bath-sports-and-leisure-centre/gym",
"name": "Gym"
    }]
  }
</code></pre>

## Describing Organisers (<code>schema:Person</code> and <code>schema:Organization</code>)

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Applications must not publish personal data without permission</strong></p>
<p>
While the [schema:Person](https://schema.org/Person) type allows a variety of information to be published about a
person, applications <em class="rfc2119">MUST</em> not publish this information as open data without consent.
</p>
</div>

To describe the people and organisations involving in organising Events, Schema.org provides the [schema:Person](https://schema.org/Person) and [schema:Organization](https://schema.org/Organization) types.

People and organisations can be associated with an Event using the [schema:organizer](https://schema.org/organizer), [schema:contributor](https://schema.org/contributor) or [oa:leader](https://openactive.io/leader) properties. These allow some flexibility in defining how a person or organisation is associated with an event. For example an event may be:

* organized by an club (`schema:organizer`)
* be led by a specific coach (`oa:leader`)
* and involve other named participants (`oa:contributor`)

To help ensure that publishers apply these properties in consistent ways, it is recommended that:

* For events taking place in a gym, the organizer should be listed as the gym (an [schema:Organization](https://schema.org/Organization))
* For "user generated" events in a booking system, the organizer should be the account under which the events were created, rather than the booking system. The instructor for the event can be specified as the `oa:leader` or `oa:contributor`
* For franchised events (e.g. Clubbercise), the organiser should be the franchisee, as they are ultimately responsible for organising that specific event

Both the [schema:Person](https://schema.org/Person) and [schema:Organization](https://schema.org/Organization) types support a common set of properties that capture the basic information required for publishing opportunity data.

|Property|Status|Format|Notes|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
|`@type`|REQUIRED|String|Person or Organization|
|`@id`|RECOMMENDED|URI|A URI providing a unique identifier for the resource|
|[schema:identifier](https://schema.org/identifier)|OPTIONAL|Number, String, [schema:PropertyValue](https://schema.org/PropertyValue) or an array of [schema:PropertyValue](https://schema.org/PropertyValue)|A local identifier for the resource.|
|[schema:url](https://schema.org/url)|RECOMMENDED for Organization. OPTIONAL for Person|URL|A URL to the homepage or other page about the organisation|
|[schema:name](https://schema.org/name)|REQUIRED for Organization.OPTIONAL for Person.|String|The name of the organisation|
|[schema:description](https://schema.org/description)|OPTIONAL|String|A description of the organisation|
|[schema:logo](https://schema.org/logo)|OPTIONAL|[schema:ImageObject](https://schema.org/ImageObject)|Logo for the organization|
|[schema:telephone](https://schema.org/telephone)|RECOMMENDED for Organization. OPTIONAL for Person.|String|Telephone number of the organization or person.|
|[schema:sameAs](https://schema.org/sameAs)|RECOMMENDED for Organization. OPTIONAL for Person.|Array of String|Lists the URL(s) of the official social media profile pages associated with the organization or person.|


The following example illustrates how to associate an [schema:Organization](https://schema.org/Organization) with an event:

<pre class="example" title="Specifying an organiser"><code>
  {
    "@context": "https://openactive.io/",
    "type": "Event",
    "url": "http://www.example.org/events/1",
    "name": "Tai chi Class",
    "description": "A tai chi class intended for beginners",
    "startDate": "2017-03-22T20:00:00-05:00",
    "duration": "PT60M",
    "organizer": [{
"type": "Organization",
"url": "http://example.org/clubs/1",
"name": "Bath Tai Chi Club",
"logo": [{
    "type": "ImageObject",
    "url": "http://www.example.org/clubs/1/logo.png"
}]
    }]
  }
</code></pre>

## Describing Activity Lists (<code>skos:ConceptScheme</code>) and Physical Activity (<code>skos:Concept</code>)

List of Physical Activities are controlled vocabularies published using the types and properties defined by the [SKOS](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/) standard. That
standard covers all the requirements [outlined in the concept model](#physical-activities), allowing:

* activities to be organised into hierarchies to capture broader-narrow relationships, e.g. "Martial Arts" and "Judo"
* sharing of alternative labels to support search and indexing
* the sharing of standard codes to support data integration

The [[OpenActive-Activity-List]] provides an openly licensed standard activity list that can be used by publishers. But where a publisher needs to publish their own list, then they can use the properties defined in the SKOS specification, as follows:

|Property|Status|Format|Notes|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
|`@type`|REQUIRED|String|ConceptScheme|
|`@id`|REQUIRED|URL|A URI providing a unique identifier for the resource|
|[schema:url](https://schema.org/url)|REQUIRED|URL|A URL that links to the Activity List|
|[dc:title](http://purl.org/dc/terms/title)|REQUIRED|String|Title of the Activity List|
|[schema:description](https://schema.org/description)|RECOMMENDED|String|Description of the activity list|
|[dc:license](http://purl.org/dc/terms/license)|RECOMMENDED|schema:url|Reference to the license under which the activity list has been published|
|[oa:concept](https://www.openactive.org/ns#concept)|REQUIRED|Array of [skos:Concept](https://www.w3.org/2009/08/skos-reference/skos.html#Concept)|List of concepts that make up the list|

The following example illustrates the basic structure of an activity list:

<pre class="example" title="Publishing an activity list"><code>
  {
    "@context": "https://openactive.io/",
    "type": "ConceptScheme",
    "id": "http://www.example.org/activity-list",
    "url": "http://www.example.org/activity-list",
    "title": "Activity List",
    "description": "An example activity list",
    "concept": [{
"type": "Concept",
"prefLabel": "Martial Arts",
"narrower": {
  "type": "Concept",
  "prefLabel": "Tai Chi"
}
    }]
  }
</code></pre>

### Describing Physical Activities

The following properties from the [[SKOS]] specification can be used to describe physical activities.

|Property|Status|Format|Notes|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
|`@type`|REQUIRED|String|Concept|
|`@id`|RECOMMENDED|URI|A URI providing a unique identifier for the resource. If the activity is defined in a openly licensed activity list, then publishers SHOULD provide its unique identifier.|
|[skos:prefLabel](https://www.w3.org/2009/08/skos-reference/skos.html#prefLabel)|REQUIRED|String|Preferred label for referring to the physical activity. The preferred labels should be used when publishing data about the activities involved in an event.|
|[skos:altLabel](https://www.w3.org/2009/08/skos-reference/skos.html#altLabel)|OPTIONAL|Array of String|Alternative labels for the physical activity|
|[skos:inScheme](https://www.w3.org/2009/08/skos-reference/skos.html#inScheme)|RECOMMENDED|URI|Refers to the Activity List in which this physical activity is defined. If an `@id` property is provided then publishers SHOULD provide this property to identify the activity list which defines the activity.|
|[skos:broader](https://www.w3.org/2009/08/skos-reference/skos.html#broader)|OPTIONAL|Array of URI|Where an Activity List is organised as a hierarchy of activities, this property can be used to refer to a parent or broader term. E.g. "Martial Arts" is broader than "Tai Chi".|
|[skos:narrower](https://www.w3.org/2009/08/skos-reference/skos.html#narrower)|OPTIONAL|Array of URI|Where an Activity List is organised as a hierarchy of activities, this property can be used to refer to a child or narrower term. E.g. "Tai Chi" is a narrower term of "Martial Arts"|
|[skos:notation](https://www.w3.org/2009/08/skos-reference/skos.html#notation)|OPTIONAL|String|Provides a unique code or identifier for an activity|


The following markup illustrates how to describe a single activity.

<pre class="example" title="Publishing an activity list"><code>
  {
    "@context": "https://openactive.io/",
    "type": "Concept",
    "id": "http://www.example.org/activity-list#tai-chi",
    "prefLabel": "Tai Chi",
    "altLabel": ["Tai-Chi"],
    "inScheme": "http://www.example.org/activity-list"
  }
</code></pre>

## Describing Offers (<code>schema:Offer</code>)

To indicate that a `schema:Event` is only available to paid attendees, opportunity data provides may include details of the offers available to participants. The [schema:Offer](https://schema.org/Offer) type provides some basic properties for indicating the price and availability of Offers.

|Property|Status|Format|Notes|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
|`@type`|REQUIRED|String|Offer|
|`@id`|RECOMMENDED|URI|A URI providing a unique identifier for the resource|
|[schema:identifier](https://schema.org/identifier)|OPTIONAL|Number, String, [schema:PropertyValue](https://schema.org/PropertyValue) or an array of [schema:PropertyValue](https://schema.org/PropertyValue)|A local identifier for the resource.|
|[schema:name](https://schema.org/name)|RECOMMENDED|String|The name of the offer suitable for display to participants|
|[schema:url](https://schema.org/url)|REQUIRED|URL|A URL that a user can click on to start a booking process for this offer|
|[schema:price](https://schema.org/price)|REQUIRED|Number|The offer price available to participants|
|[schema:priceCurrency](https://schema.org/priceCurrency)|RECOMMENDED|String|The currency of the offer price. Specified as a 3-letter ISO 4217 value. If an Offer has a zero price, then this property is not required. Otherwise the currency MUST be specified.|
|[oa:ageRange](https://openactive.io/ageRange)|RECOMMENDED|[schema:QuantitativeValue](https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue)|Indicates that an Offer is applicable to a specific age range. Specified as a [QuantitativeValue](https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue) with [minValue](https://schema.org/minValue) and [maxValue](https://schema.org/maxValue) properties.|
|[oa:advanceBooking](https://openactive.io/advanceBooking)|OPTIONAL|[oa:RequiredStatusType](https://openactive.io/RequiredStatusType)|Indicates whether to accept this offer, a participant must book in advance, whether they must pay on attending, or have option to do either. Values MUST be one of the three URIs defined by this specification (see below).|
|[oa:prepayment](https://openactive.io/prepayment)|OPTIONAL|[oa:RequiredStatusType](https://openactive.io/RequiredStatusType)|Indicates whether to accept this offer, a participant must pay in advance, pay when attending, or have the option to do either. Values MUST be one of the three URIs defined by this specification (see below).|


The following example shows an event which offers a price for attending a single session.

<pre class="example" title="Describing an Offer"><code>
  {
    "@context": "https://openactive.io/",
    "type": "Event",
    "url": "http://www.example.org/events/1",
    "name": "Tai chi Class",
    "description": "A tai chi class intended for beginners",
    "duration": "PT60M",
    "offers": [{
"type": "Offer",
"name": "Single session",
"price": 5,
"priceCurrency": "GBP"
    }]
  }
</code></pre>

<div class="note">
Schema.org provides [additional properties for describing Offers](https://schema.org/Offer). The above model highlights the properties
that support the most common, basic use case. Future versions of this specification may include more detail around describing offers.
</div>

### Advance booking and prepayment

This specification defines two new properties that can be used to describe
whether advance booking and prepayment is supported for an Offer.

The legal values for the [oa:advanceBooking](https://openactive.io/advanceBooking) and
[oa:prepayment](https://openactive.io/prepayment) properties and their
interpretation are:

|Value|`oa:advanceBooking`|`oa:prepayment`|
|--- |--- |--- |
|https://openactive.io/Required|Participants must book in advance|Participants must pay in advance|
|https://openactive.io/Optional|Participants have the option to book in advance|Participants may pay in advance or pay on arrival|
|https://openactive.io/Unavailable|Advance booking is not available. Users must turn up|Prepayment is not available. Users may be able to book in advance but must pay on the door|


These two properties can be combined to describe the full range of options available
to participants. Some combinations are restricted, for example a publisher
MUST NOT specify a `oa:prepayment` option if there advanced booking is not available.

<p></p>

## Describing Slots (<code>oa:Slot</code>)

A Slot is an opportunity to use a facility at a specific time and for a
specified duration. A Slot is therefore a specific type of Event, although
it has a more constrained set of properties.

A series of Slots describes a calendar during which a facility is available
for use.

Slots are always associated with a [oa:FacilityUse](https://openactive.io/FacilityUse)
product which may link to more detail about the facility on offer and the costs
for hire.

|Property|Status|Format|Notes|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
|`@type`|REQUIRED|String|Slot|
|`@id`|RECOMMENDED|URI|A URI providing a unique identifier for the resource|
|[schema:identifier](https://schema.org/identifier)|OPTIONAL|Number, String, [schema:PropertyValue](https://schema.org/PropertyValue) or an array of [schema:PropertyValue](https://schema.org/PropertyValue)|A local identifier for the resource.|

|[schema:endDate](https://schema.org/endDate)|OPTIONAL|String|The end date and time of the event. Can be specified as a [schema:Date](https://schema.org/Date) or [schema:DateTime](https://schema.org/DateTime)|
|[schema:duration](https://schema.org/duration)|REQUIRED|String|The duration of the event given in [[ISO8601]] format.  Durations MUST NOT be zero length.|
|[schema:offers](https://schema.org/offers)|RECOMMENDED|Array of [schema:Offer](https://schema.org/Offer)|Describes offers to book and use this specific slot. If unspecified, then a client SHOULD use offers associated with the related Facility Use.|
|[oa:remainingUses](https://openactive.io/remainingUses)|REQUIRED|Number|Used to indicate the availability of this Slot. Where a Slot describes the opportunity to use a single facility this property should have a value of 0 or 1. Where a Slot describes the opportunity to use one of several facilities, which will be allocated during booking, then the property specific how many such facilities are remaining, and may then have a value greater than 1.|
|[oa:maximumUses](https://openactive.io/maximumUses)|RECOMMENDED|Number|Where a Slot describes the opportunity to use one of several facilities, which will be allocated during booking, then this value can be used to indicate how many facilities might be available.|


Examples of describing a Slot are given in the next section.

## Describing Facility Use (<code>oa:FacilityUse</code>, <code>oa:IndividualFacilityUse</code>)

A Facility Use is a subclass of [schema:Product](https://schema.org/Product). It describes an opportunity to use either one of
a group of facilities (<code>oa:FacilityUse</code>) or a individual facility
(<code>oa:IndividualFacilityUse</code>).

The opportunity to use a facility is divided into a calendar of Slots, which
allow a participant to use that facility for a specified time and duration.

The following example describes opportunities to use table tennis facilities at
a leisure centre. By default use of a table is for 30 minutes and costs ten
pounds.

However at specific times the cost to use a table increases. This is indicated
by offers associated with the second Slot.

In both cases a maximum of four tables are available. In the example, only one
table remains for use in the first slot, while the second has three.

<div class="note">
<p>
The community group feels that the data model proposed in this section adequately covers the primary use cases relating to publishing data on opportunities to hire and use facilities</p>
<p>However we recognise that there may be some consequences on the volume of data shared via [RPDE feeds](https://www.openactive.io/realtime-paged-data-exchange/). Specifically, for multi-use facilities the booking of mutually exclusive configurations will end up increasing the volume of updates that need to be communicated to users.
</p>
<p>The community group has documented this issue and [requests feedback from publishers and users](https://github.com/openactive/modelling-opportunity-data/issues/73) based on implementation feedback before deciding how to address the issue.</p>

## Describing Route Guidance (`oa:RouteGuidance`)

The purpose of the __Route Guidance__ model is to describe a __Route__: that is to say, while it concerns and points to geographic information, it is not itself a geo-information type.

Route Guidance is often generated over an extended period of curation: that is to say, initially sparse information about a Route is frequently augmented over time, until a full description of the Route emerges. While the Route Guidance model is rich, then, the number of REQUIRED fields is relatively small, in keeping with this curation workflow.

</div>

### Describing Maps: `oa:geoPath` and `oa:mapImage`

Cartographic representations of `Route`s ('maps', in common parlance) are typically provided in one of two format families: properly geographic format types, such as [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) or the [.osm format](https://learnosm.org/en/osm-data/file-formats/), which support sophisticated geo-specific functionality such as distance calculation or route-tracking; and simple images, such as .jpg files, which provide a visual overview of the relevant area but do not offer any further functionality.

The first kind of map should populate the `oa:geoPath` property; for the second, the `oa:mapImage` property should be used. In both cases, the relevant maps are modelled using the schema.org [`Map`](https://schema.org/Map) class. However, the data-profile of these `Maps` will differ slightly.

#### `oa:geoPath`

|[`schema:image`](https://schema.org/image)|REQUIRED|[`schema:URL`](https://schema.org/ImageObject)|A link to the image file depicting the map.|

### Describing Route Points: Start, End, and Of Interest (`schema:Place`)

`Route`s are typically characterised by a number of points of special significance along their path: at a minimum, in the case of a looping `Route`, a `startPoint`, but often also an `endPoint` and sometimes various other `pointsOfInterest` along the way.

Such points, for the purpose of describing `Route`s, are `schema:Place`s. However, the restricted but distinctive requirements `Route`s impose mean that particular attention should be paid to the properties listed below, some of which are unique to the OpenActive namespace:

|Property|Status|Type|Notes|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
|@type|REQUIRED|[schema:Text](https://schema.org/Text)|`RoutePoint`|
|[schema:name](https://schema.org/name)|OPTIONAL|[schema:Text](https://schema.org.Text)||
|[schema:geo](https://schema.org/geo)|OPTIONAL|[schema:GeoCoordinates](https://schema.org/GeoCoordinates)|The geographic co-ordinates, specified as a latitude and longitude of a Place|
|[oa:isAccessPoint](https://openactive.io/isAccessPoint)|OPTIONAL|[schema:Boolean](https://schema.org/Boolean)|Whether or not it is possible to join the Route as a whole at this point. On `RouteGuidance``startPoint` and `endPoint` attributes this defaults to `true`; otherwise it defaults to `false`.|
|[oa:mapReference](https://openactive.io/mapReference)|OPTIONAL|Array of [oa:MapReference](https://openactive.io/MapReference)||
|[oa:transportNote](https://openactive.io/transportNote)|OPTIONAL|Array of [oa:TransportNote](https://openactive.io/TransportNote)|Information about how to reach the `routePoint`.|
|[oa:shortDescription](https://openactive.io/shortDescription)|OPTIONAL|[schema:Text](https://schema.org/Text)||
|[schema:description](https://schema.org/description)|REQUIRED|[schema:Text](https://schema.org/Text)||
|[schema:amenityFeature](https://schema.org/amenityFeature)|RECOMMENDED|Array of [schema:LocationFeatureSpecification](https://schema.org/LocationFeatureSpecification)|Used to indicate whether specific amenities are available at a location. The value of this property will be an array of [schema:LocationFeatureSpecification](https://schema.org/LocationFeatureSpecification) objects. See "Describing Amenities" for more information.|
|[oa:userContributedContent](https://openactive.io/userContributedContent)|OPTIONAL|Array of [schema:CreativeWork](https://schema.org/CreativeWork)|Links to user-generated content, such as e.g. images or descriptions of the Route, video or path-recordings of their traversal of the Route, etc. If this field is populated, it is recommended that the data-publisher have some means of filtering and otherwise curating user-generated content prior to publication.|
|[schema:sameAs](https://schema.org/sameAd)|OPTIONAL|[schema:URL](https://schema.org/URL)|URL of a reference Web page that unambiguously indicates the Place's identity. E.g. the URL of the item's Wikipedia page, Wikidata entry, or official website.|

### Describing Map References (`oa:MapReference`)

An `oa:MapReference` is simply a geographic reference specified in terms of some widely-used map or series of maps. In the UK, for instance, the Ordnance Survey Explorer and Landranger maps are frequently used to indicate the boundaries within which a geographic entity falls.

|Property|Status|Type|Notes|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
|@type|REQUIRED|[schema:Text](https://schema.org/Text)|`MapReference`|
|[schema:publisher](https://schema.org/publisher)|REQUIRED|[schema:Organization](https://schema.org/Organization) or [schema:Person](https://schema.org/Person)||
|[mapSeries](https://openactive.io/mapSeries)|OPTIONAL|[schema:Text](https://schema.org/Text)|e.g. 'Explorer', 'Landranger'|
|[mapNumber](https://openactive.io/mapNumber)|OPTIONAL|[schema:Text](https://schema.org/Text)|REQUIRED if no gridReference supplied|
|[gridReference](https://openactive.io/gridReference)|OPTIONAL|[schema:Text](https://schema.org/Text)|REQUIRED if no mapNumber supplied|


### Describing Route Gradients (`oa:RouteGradient`)

An `oa:RouteGradient` captures the steepness of climb and descent along a Route. Data providers should bear in mind that many descriptors of gradient are mathematical and/or unstandardised in nature (e.g., when specified in terms of percentages), and may convey little to novice users. The provision of a gradient `description` is therefore RECOMMENDED.

In addition, gradient is often used as a component in, or proxy for, description of the difficulty of completing a given Route. Data publishers should therefore give careful thought as to whether their gradient information is better captured using the `RouteGradient` or `RouteDifficulty` models.

|Property|Status|Type|Notes|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
|@type|REQUIRED|[schema:Text](https://schema.org/Text)|`RouteGradient`|
|[oa:maxGradient](https://openactive.io/maxGradient)|RECOMMENDED|[schema:Text](https://schema.org/Text)|e.g. "7.5%", "4.2°"|
|[oa:avgGradient](https://openactive.io/avgGradient)|RECOMMENDED|[schema:Text](https://schema.org/Text)||
|[oa:totalElevationGain](https://openactive.io/totalElevationGain)|OPTIONAL|Integer|Unit is metres.|
|[oa:totalElevationLoss](https://openactive.io/totalElevationLoss)|OPTIONAL|Integer|Unit is metres.|
|[oa:gradientTerm](https://openactive.io/gradientTerm)|OPTIONAL|Array of [schema:Text](https://schema.org/Text)|e.g. "Easy", "Moderate", "3"|
|[oa:gradientDefinitionURL](https://openactive.io/gradientDefinitionURL)|OPTIONAL|[schema:URL](https://schema.org/URL)|This will typically be a link to a page describing the meaning of the gradientTerm in more detail.|
|[schema:description](https://schema.org/description)|RECOMMENDED|[schema:Text](https://schema.org/Text)||

### Describing Transport to and from the Route (`oa:transportNote`)

|Property|Status|Type|Notes|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
|@type|REQUIRED|[schema:Text](https://schema.org/Text)|`transportNote`|
|[oa:transportMode](https://openactive.io/transportMode)|REQUIRED|[schema:Text](https://schema.org/Text)|e.g. 'Bus', 'Train', 'Road'|
|[schema:description](https://schema.org/description)|REQUIRED|[schema:Text](https://schema.org/Text)|Instructions for navigation to the destination by means of the `oa:transportMode`|

<div class="note">
It is RECOMMENDED that the value of `oa:transportMode` be taken from the following list: "Bus", "Rail", "Bicycle", "Road", or "Foot".
</div>

### Describing Route Difficulty (`oa:RouteDifficulty`)

The `oa:RouteDifficulty` model describes the effort and level of fitness required to successfully complete a Route. Such assessments necessarily contain a strong subjective component, and data publishers are thus encouraged to use the `[schema:description](https://schema.org/description)` field to ground their assessment in more concrete terms such as distance and gradient, and/or to provide a `difficultyDefinitionURL` further explaining the rationale behind it.

|Property|Status|Type|Notes|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
|@type|REQUIRED|[schema:Text](https://schema.org/Text)|`RouteDifficulty`|
|[oa:difficultyTerm](https://openactive.io/difficultyTerm)|OPTIONAL|[schema:Text](https://schema.org/Text)||
|[schema:description](https://schema.org/description)|OPTIONAL|[schema:Text](https://schema.org/Text)|e.g., 'Easy', 'Strenuous'|
|[oa:difficultyDefinitionURL](https://openactive.io/difficultyDefinitionURL)|OPTIONAL|[schema:URL](https://schema.org/URL)|This will typically be a link to a page describing the meaning of the difficultyTerm in more detail, e.g. https://www.ramblers.org.uk/go-walking/about-group-walks/walks-difficulty.aspx|

### Describing Route Legal Advisories (`oa:RouteLegalAdvisory`)

Users of Routes, particularly in rural areas, need to be apprised of their legal status: that is to say, whether and under what conditions they are legally allowed to avail themselves of all sections of the Route. In most cases this can be done concisely by indicating the `oa:routeDesignation`; further nuances or exceptional cases should be dealt with in more detail using the `description` and `legalInformationURL` fields.

|Property|Status|Type|
|--- |--- |--- |
|@type|REQUIRED|[schema:Text](https://schema.org/Text)|`RouteLegalAdvisory`|
|[oa:routeDesignation](https://openactive.io/routeDesignation)|RECOMMENDED|[oa:RouteDesignation](https://openactive.io/RouteDesignation)|
|[schema:description](https://schema.org/description)|OPTIONAL|[schema:Text](https://schema.org/Text)|
|[oa:legalInformationURL](https://openactive.io/legalInformationURL)|OPTIONAL|[schema:URL](https://schema.org/URL)|

### Describing Indicative Durations (`oa:IndicativeDuration`)

Being able to complete a Route within a given time is important to many users, particularly those who engage infrequently in outdoor activities because they feel pressed for time. While there is considerable variance in individual activity speed, providing a rough indication of how much time to allow can nevertheless be valuable.

|Property|Status|Type|Notes|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
|@type|REQUIRED|[schema:Text](https://schema.org/Text)|`IndicativeDuration`|
|[oa:activity](https://openactive.io/activity)|REQUIRED|[skos:Concept](https://www.w3.org/2009/08/skos-reference/skos.html#Concept)|Specifies the physical activity for which the [schema:duration](https://schema.org/duration) is relevant. This activity SHOULD ideally be taken from an activity list.|
|[schema:duration](https://schema.org/duration)|REQUIRED|String|The duration of the event given in [[ISO8601]] format.  Durations MUST NOT be zero length.|

### Describing Route Designations (`oa:RouteDesignation`)

An `oa:RouteDesignation` is a formal, legal declaration of the status of a given Route or Route Segment. As such, any given jurisdiction will define only a finite (usually quite small) number of possible Designations.

|Property|Status|Type|Notes|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
|@type|REQUIRED|[schema:Text](https://schema.org/Text)|`RouteDesignation`|
|[oa:routeDesignationTerm](https://openactive.io/routeDesignationTerm)|REQUIRED|Array of [schema:Text](https://schema.org/Text)|See Example below|
|[schema:description](https://schema.org/description)|OPTIONAL|[schema:Text](https://schema.org/Text)||
|[schema:url](https://schema.org/url)|OPTIONAL|[schema:URL](https://schema.org/URL)||

<div class="example">
  <strong>Example: Route Designations in the UK</strong>
  <p>
In the UK, the number of legal statuses a Route might have is quite small,
and all Routes will therefore be some assortment of:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Footpath</li>
<li>Bridleway</li>
<li>Byway Open to All Traffic</li>
<li>Restricted Byway</li>
<li>Recreational Route</li>
<li>National Trail</li>
<li>Highway Cycle Route</li>
<li>Other Public Access Route</li>
<li>Permissive Footpath</li>
<li>Permissive Bridleway</li>
<li>Traffic-free Cycle Route</li>
<li>National Cycle Network</li>
<li>Danger Area</li>
<li>Managed Access</li>
<li>Open Access Land</li>
<li>Right To Roam</li>
</ul>
<p>
The `routeDesignationTerm` field is reserved for strictly-defined terms such as these. The `RouteDesignation` `description` property is then intended to hold a formal, legal definition of this `routeDesignationTerm`: for example,
</p>

<blockquote>
**Restricted byway** – on these routes there are restrictions on how you can travel the route. You are permitted to use the route on foot, horseback, bicycle or horse drawn carriage. You cannot use any motorised vehicles along this route.
</blockquote>
<p>
The `url` property is intended to hold a link resolving to a definition or further explanation of this term: for example, the webpage from which the above definition has been taken: https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/blog/2011/08/rights-of-way/.
</p>
</div>

### Describing Route Risk Advisories (`oa:RouteRiskAdvisory`)

The purpose of the `oa:RouteRiskAdvisory` model is to describe risks in sufficient detail that users are able to weigh these and feel they are making an adequately-informed choice when deciding to avail themselves of a Route.

Because the range of risks users may be concerned with is wide, including such disparate areas as personal threat, environmental factors, and shared use of Routes with other traffic; because individuals vary widely in the degree of risk they are prepared to tolerate; and because perceptions of risk involve a subjective component the `oa:RouteRiskAdvisory` model is intentionally eclectic and captures information in a variety of styles.

<div class="note">
<p>
  While modelling risk is challenging, user research also indicates it is a paramount concern, particularly amongst those who are inexperienced with or hesitant to engage in outdoor activities. Data publishers are RECOMMENDED to provide any and all risk information they can.
</p>
<p>
To avoid potential confusion between absence of risk information and absence of risk, in cases where no risk information is available it is RECOMMENDED that publishers indicate this explicitly.
</p>
</div>

|[oa:trafficDescription](https://openactive.io/trafficDescription)|OPTIONAL|[schema:Text](https://schema.org/Text)||

### Describing Route Restrictions (`oa:RouteAccessRestriction`)

Route Access Restrictions convey information regardihg restrictions on use or access to the Route that arising from reasons other than legal status, e.g., social convention, wildlife protection, or seasonal factors.

|Property|Status|Type|Notes|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
|@type|REQUIRED|[schema:Text](https://schema.org/Text)|`RouteAccessRestriction`|

### Segmenting Routes: Routes as a collection of sub-Routes

In practice, Routes are often broken down into a series of smaller units - so that, for instance, a scenic walk may be described in terms of traversals to various landmarks, or a multi-day cycle tour broken down into individual day or half-day progressions. These smaller units are here referred to as __Route Segments__, and they are described by __Route Segment Guidance__.

__Route Segments__ are treated, for the purposes of this specification, as essentially identical to __Routes__: that is to say, they are themselves simply __Routes__ that happen to fall in a particular sequence and thereby comprise a larger __Route__.

Route Segment Guidance, then, is identical to Route Guidance, with the following exceptions:

1. The presence of a mandatory `sequence` attribute. The value of this attribute MUST be an integer, and the values of the `sequence` attribute MUST run consecutively for the Route Segments comprising a Route.

1. The availability of an OPTIONAL `alternativeSegmentTo` attribute, in cases where the end user may select from a variety of alternative `Route Segment`s (e.g., a short and steep `Segment` alongside a longer, more leisurely, alternative) to complete their journey.

1. Segments MUST NOT themselves contains Segments. That is to say, the `segments` attribute is FORBIDDEN for Route Segment Guidance.

1. Because the parent Route Guidance can be assumed to convey the necessary information to users, all attributes are OPTIONAL for Route Segments, even those that marked as REQUIRED for Route Guidance.

In addition, the following structural constraints apply:

1. If a Route contains Route Segments at all, it must contain AT LEAST two Segments. That is to say, a Route cannot consist of only a single Segment.

1.  If a Route contains Route Segments at all, these Segments MUST describe the entirety of the Route: there should be no 'gaps' left unaccounted for by the Segments.

|Property|Status|Type|Notes|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
|[oa:sequence](https://openactive.io/sequence)|RECOMMENDED|Integer|Indicates the presentation order of `Route Segment`s within the parent `Route`. This ordering should normally be present, except for unusual situations such as e.g., modelling `RouteGuidance` that is otherwise unsegmented but for access points. In cases where `RouteSegmentGroup`s are provided, this property is REQUIRED (See below, [Grouping Route Segments](#grouping-route-segments-oa-routesegmentgroup)).|
|[schema:alternativeRouteSegmentGuidance](https://schema.org/alternativeSegmentTo)|OPTIONAL|Array of schema:URL|An array of `@id` values pointing to RouteSegment Metadata describing alternative `RouteSegment`s that may be taken in preference to the declaring `Segment`.|

<div class="note">
The intention of the `sequence` attribute is to provide a guide regarding presentational order of the `Route Segments` to client applications, which will not necessarily correspond with the physical ordering of `Segments` along the `Route`. Ordering must thus be sequential even in cases where multiple alternative `Segments` exist.
</div>

#### Inheritance semantics between Route Guidance and Route Segment Guidance

Given that, for the most part, Route Guidance and Route Segment Guidance contain the same properties, how are they to be distributed between these two similar, but not identical, objects?

Modelling here is to be guided by the principle that some properties (e.g., `originatingPublisher`, `createdBy`) are relatively generic, and hence heritable downwards from Route Guidance to Route Segment Guidance, while others are specific to one level or another (for example, `distance`: the total length of a Route will necessarily be different from that of its individual Segments).

The table below indicates which Route Guidance properties should be viewed as inherited, and which not:

|Property|Inherited?|
|--- |--- |
|`@type`|No|
|`@id`|Yes|
|[schema:name](https://schema.org/name)|Yes|
|[oa:originatingPublisher](https://openactive.io/originatingPublisher)|Yes|
|[oa:createdBy](https://openactive.io/createdBy)|Yes|
|[schema:datePublished](https://schema.org/datePublished)|Yes|
|[oa:dateModified](https://openactive.io/dateModified)|Yes|
|[oa:verifiedBy](https://openactive.io/verifiedBy)|Yes|
|[oa:dateVerified](https://openactive.io/dateVerified)|Yes|
|`schema:url`|Yes|
|[schema:description](https://schema.org/description)|Yes|
|[oa:shortDescription](https://openactive.io/shortDescription)|Yes|
|[oa:activity](https://openactive.io/activity)|Yes|
|`beta:distance`|No|
|[oa:startPoint](https://openactive.io/startPoint)|No|
|[oa:endPoint](https://openactive.io/endPoint)|No|
|[oa:pointOfInterest](https://openactive.io/pointOfInterest)|No|
|[oa:accessibiltyDescription](https://openactive.io/accessibiltyDescription)|Yes|
|[oa:gradient](https://openactive.io/gradient)|No|
|[oa:surface](https://openactive.io/surface)|Yes|
|[oa:originatingWebsite](https://openactive.io/originatingWebsite)|Yes|
|[oa:routeDifficulty](https://openactive.io/routeDifficulty)|Yes|
|[oa:geoPath](https://openactive.io/geoPath)|Yes|
|[oa:mapImage](https://openactive.io/mapImage)|Yes|
|[oa:category](https://openactive.io/category)|Yes|
|[schema:amenityFeature](https://schema.org/amenityFeature)|No|
|[oa:isLoop](https://openactive.io/isLoop)|No|
|[oa:riskInformation](https://openactive.io/riskInformation)|Yes|
|[oa:legalAdvisory](https://openactive.io/legalAdvisory)|Yes|
|[oa:routeAccessRestriction](https://openactive.io/routeAccessRestriction)|Yes|
|[schema:image](https://schema.org/image)|Yes|
|[schema:review](https://schema.org/review)|Yes|
|[oa:indicativeDuration](https://schema.org/indicativeDuration)|No|
|[oa:suggestedEquipment](https://schema.org/suggestedEquipment)|Yes|
|[schema:contactPoint](https://schema.org/contactPoint)|Yes|
|[oa:userContributedContent](https://schema.org/userContributedContent)|No|
|[oa:segmentGroups](https://schema.org/segmentGroups)|N/A|
|[oa:segments](https://openactive.io/segments)|N/A|
|[oa:alternativeSegmentTo](https://openactive.io/alternativeSegmentTo)|N/A|

When it comes to cases where a property may be declared either at the level of Route or Route Segment Guidance, modelling decisions must simply be made on the basis of scope: properties declared at the Route level apply to the Route as a whole, and hence of each Segment within it; those declared on a Segment apply ONLY to that particular Segment.

### Grouping Route Segments (`oa:RouteSegmentGroup`)

In the case of exceptionally lengthy routes (see e.g. ExploreKent's [Elham Valley Way](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/explore-kent-bucket/uploads/2015/02/18163918/explore-kent-long-distance-route-elham-valley-way.pdf) walk), individual Route Segments may be grouped together into larger wholes to indicate, e.g., which Segments should ideally be covered in a single day, link together significant sites along the route, etc. In such cases, these larger groupings should be indicated using `oa:RouteSegmentGroup` objects.

|Property|Status|Type|Notes|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
|@type|REQUIRED|`"RouteSegmentGroup"`||
|@id|RECOMMENDED|URI|A URI providing a unique, stable identifier for the resource. Note that an `@id` value is REQUIRED if `alternativeGroupTo` is supplied.|
|[schema:name](https://schema.org/name)|REQUIRED|String|The name of the grouping.|
|[schema:description](https://schema.org/description)|RECOMMENDED|String|A free text description of the grouping.|
|[`oa:includesSegments`](https://openactive.io/includesSegments)|Array of [URL](http://schema.org/URL)|The individual `RouteSegmentGuidance` objects the `RouteSegmentGroup` comprises, as identified by the value of their `@id`.|
|[`alternativeGroupTo`](https://openactive.io/isAlternativeGroupTo)|Array of [URL](http://schema.org/URL)|Used to indicate that this `RouteSegmentGroup`'s collection of `RouteSegmentGuidance` serves as an alternative to the group identified in the `Array`. Where this value is supplied, it is RECOMMENDED that the `description` supply reasons why one or another alternative (e.g. distance, accessibility) might be preferred.  |
<p></p>

### Describing User Generated Content (`oa:userGeneratedContent`)

Users are often prolific in creating a wide range of supplemental material – e.g images, descriptions, GPX track recordings – for Routes, and such contributions can often considerably enrich `RouteGuidance` data. The sheer – and open-ended – variety of possible contributions means that they are modelled using `schema:CreativeWork`. This type is extremely flexible, and implementers are encouraged to avail themselves of as much of this flexibility as is considered desirable; however, the properties and usage given below are given for guidance and as potentially useful starting-points.

|Property|Status|Type|Notes|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
|@type|REQUIRED|`"CreativeWork"`||
|[schema:creator](https://schema.org/creator)|RECOMMENDED|String|The individual, howsoever identified (e.g. full name, user handle), responsible for creating the content.|
|[schema:accountablePerson](http://schema.org/accountablePerson)|RECOMMENDED|[Person](http://schema.org/Person)]|In the context of user-generated content, the `accountablePerson` is the editor, curator, or reviewer who approves and if necessary edits the user-contented submissions prior to publication.|
|[schema:spatialCoverage](https://schema.org/spatialCoverage)|REQUIRED|String|	The spatialCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the place(s) which are the focus of the content - typically, in this context, the location of the `Route`, or points along it.|
|[schema:associatedMedia](https://schema.org/spatialCoverage)|REQUIRED|String|	The spatialCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the place(s) which are the focus of the content - typically, in this context, the location of the `Route`, or points along it.|

## Extending the Model

The previous sections describe how to publish opportunity data using a combination of existing and new vocabularies.
But this approach may not address every requirement. Specific applications may need custom extensions and the community may need to
revise or improve the core model presented here.

Future versions of the specification may have a wider scope, e.g. to support description of facilities, equipment,
event booking or accreditation schemes for sporting organisations.

With this in mind, the following sections briefly outline some expected ways in which this specification and the practice of
publishing of opportunity data may evolve.

To support changing practice, consumers of opportunity data <em class="rfc2119">SHOULD</em> be liberal in what they accept
from data publishers, to allow the use of additional properties.

### Versioning Policy

The broad goal is to ensure that future versions of this specification
remain backwards compatible. This will ensure that published data remains valid.

New types of resource, relationships and properties can easily be added to
extend the model without impacting existing data. Potential breaking changes
would include changing the definitions of existing properties, or removing
them from the specification.

To avoid this, the goal will be to:

* evolve the definitions of existing properties to broadly retain their current meaning and legal values.
* deprecate, rather than remove properties that are judged, based on implementation experience, to be less useful or confusing. Deprecated properties will be clearly marked in both the human and machine-readable versions of the OpenActive namespace.
* ensure that conformance criteria are loosely defined, balancing the need to be able to validate data against a desire to allow
some evolution in practice
* use version numbering to indicate potential for breaking changes. Minor versions,
e.g. 1.1, 2.1, etc should be backwards compatible. Major versions, e.g. 2.0, 3.0
are likely to include breaking changes.

Proposed changes to the specification will also be communicated in advance of
their formal release, through the sharing of public Editor's Drafts. This will
provide opportunities for both publishers and users of the data to update their applications.

### Relationship with Schema.org and SKOS

This specification draws heavily on [[SCHEMA-ORG]] and [[SKOS]] to define its
core data model. This is supplemented with additional custom types and properties
that capture additional requirements for the physical activity sector.

The [[SCHEMA-ORG]] and [[SKOS]] specifications define additional properties
that are not directly referenced in this document.

Rather than reflect the whole of these specifications in this document, we have
chosen to include those types and properties that:

* are necessary to document a basic framework for publishing opportunity data
* are useful to highlight to encourage consistent usage across the community
* have stricter conformance rules that used by [[SCHEMA-ORG]]. For example where
we have agreed to specific uses of properties to increase quality and consistency
in how data is being published

However data publishers are free to use any additional types and properties
where useful. [[SCHEMA-ORG]] in particular provides a source of a wide range
of additional properties for describing Events, Places, Organisations, etc.

For example an application may wish to share reviews of events, places or
clubs. The [schema:review](https://schema.org/review) property and its
related data model can be used for this purpose, without requiring revisions
to this specification.

### Defining Custom Vocabularies

Individual publishers, or members of the community may identify new requirements
for publishing opportunity data that are not covered by this specification or
[[SCHEMA-ORG]].

These new requirements might result in:

* submission of proposals to the OpenActive Community Group for revisions to this
specification
* creation of new specifications that support the needs fo specific types of publisher.
For example a group of publishers might wish to define a detailed specification for
describing the characteristics of cycle tracks
* creation of bespoke properties that support the needs of a specific publisher
and their data users

In all of these cases we encourage discussion of requirements and extensions via
the OpenActive Community Group, as the primary forum for standarding the
publication of opportunity data.

#### Defining and Using Custom Namespaces

The data model described in this specification is defined in
the [OpenActive JSON-LD context](https://openactive.io/ns/oa.jsonld) defined by [[OpenActive-Vocabulary]].

They <em class="rfc2119">SHOULD</em> also:

* publish public, human-readable documentation that describes their extension,
including any custom properties, types and controlled vocabularies that are
being used
* share the documentation with the OpenActive community group
* look for opportunities to align their data model with revisions to the
standard and other extensions defined in the community

Publish <em class="rfc2119">MUST</em> also

* avoid using names for custom types or properties that clash with the core
data model
* publish a custom [JSON-LD context](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#the-context) to provide a machine-readable version of their extension
* include a reference to their context in their published data

A full tutorial on creating JSON-LD contexts is outside the scope of this specification.

[[JSON-LD]] allows data to be [published with reference to multiple contexts](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#advanced-context-usage).

Assuming that a JSON-LD context using the prefix `ext:` was published to `https://example.org/custom.jsonld`, then
the following example shows how to use this extension:

<pre class="example" title="Example of a custom context"><code>
  {
    "@context": [
"https://openactive.io/",
"https://example.org/custom.jsonld"
    ],
    "type": "Event",
    "ext:myCustomProperty": "foo"
  }
</code></pre>

Publishers <em class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</em> use unprefixed property and type
names.

Using a separate context and prefixed names will help to clarify for users when
a dataset is referencing one or more extensions.

#### Beta Namespace

The [[OpenActive-Beta-Namespace]] provides a custom namespace that can be used
by publishers experimenting with new properties that are likely to be added to
the core specification.

It is defined as a convenience to help document properties that are in active
testing and review by the community. Publishers <em class="rfc2119">SHOULD NOT</em>
assume that properties in the `beta` namespace will either be added to the core
specification or be included in the namespace over the long term.

Publishers needing additional custom properties <em class="rfc2119">SHOULD</em>
define their own namespace.
