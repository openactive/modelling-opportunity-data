<p>This specification introduces a data model to support the publication of data describing 
opportunities for people to engage in physical activities ("opportunity data"). This model 
covers description of activities, as well as the events and locations in which they take place.</p>

<p>The specification is intended to support the publication of opportunity data as open data 
for anyone to access, use and share. It will also guide reusers of opportunity data, 
introducing them to the key concepts relevant to that sector.</p>

<p>The model may also be useful in guiding the development of both new and existing booking 
systems and applications that consume opportunity data.</p>

<p>The specification is an output of the [OpenActive Community Group](http://www.w3.org/community/openactive/) 
and serves as a common reference point for other specifications and outputs of that activity.</p>

<p>Developers looking for a quick primer on the model and how to use it to structure opportunity data may want to refer to the 
[[Publishing-Opportunity-Data]] primer which provides a number of additional examples.</p> 

<p>The data model introduced in this document has been mapped to existing standards and vocabularies, including 
SKOS ([[SKOS]]) and the Schema.org ([[SCHEMA-ORG]]) types and properties. This existing work provides a 
useful existing framework around which the 
[OpenActive Community Group](http://www.w3.org/community/openactive/) can build additional data standards.</p>

    <section class="informative">
# Introduction

The [W3C OpenActive Community Group](http://www.w3.org/community/openactive/) was 
established with the objective of facilitating the sharing and use of 
physical activity data. Open publishing of this data has enormous potential to increase 
participation in physical activities.

## Categories of Physical Activity Data

There are several different categories of data that are relevant to physical activities. 
This data covers different parts of [the data spectrum](http://theodi.org/data-spectrum) 
and is represented in the following diagram.

    <figure>
      ![](images/opportunity-data.png)
      <figcaption>Types of physical activity data</figcaption>
    </figure>

Some of this data is shared data. It can only be accessed by 
specific people or groups, under terms and conditions that define how and when 
it can be accessed and used. This shared data includes personal data about 
people taking part in activities and participation data that describes how people have 
been involved in previous events. 

Some of this data can be open data. Open data is data that anyone can access, use and share. 
All of the following types of data can be published as open data:

* descriptions and lists of physical activities 
* details of the locations and venues at which activities or events takes place
* the facilities available at those locations
* the details of event involving physical activities e.g. when and where they will take place, restrictions 
on attendance, costs, etc
* any related information, e.g. about the format of the event, its organisers, etc

Collectively this is known as __*opportunity data*__.

## Requirements

This specification has been developed to meet a broad set of requirements.

### Support all types of opportunity data

As described in the previous section, opportunity data covers a variety of different types of 
information including data on venues, activities and events. The specification should support 
publication of all of these different types of data

### Support discovery of opportunities

The aim of the OpenActive initiative is to encourage people to be more physically active. This means 
that this specification should focus on the data that will help people discover these 
opportunities. 

### Support all physical activities

The specification should be inclusive and support sharing of opportunity data about 
all types of physical activities, not just sports.

### Allow sharing of activity lists 

At present the physical activity sector does not have a standard list of physical activities. 
The specification should allow data providers to share the lists they have and support the 
sector in moving towards a standardised list of physical activities

### Support a variety of sources

Opportunity data is collected and held in a variety of different tools, platforms and websites. 
There is variation in the amount of detail held about individual events so the specification must 
provide flexibility to share what data is currently available, whilst guiding activity providers 
towards additional useful data to collect about events.

### Be agnostic to formats and APIs

Reflecting the wide variety of tools and platforms in use, and also that the sector is at an 
early stage in sharing its data more widely, this specification should not prescribe specific 
data formats or APIs. Ideally opportunity data could be published as JSON, XML, CSV or other formats.

### Create an extensible framework

This specification should support extensions to allow it to be customised and revised to meet future 
requirements, as well as the needs of specific communities of data publishers and consumers.

## Scope

This specification defines a data model for opportunity data. This reflects the goal of 
[the OpenActive initiative](https://www.openactive.io/) whose aim is to 
encourage the publishing and reuse of open data that might help people to become 
more active.

The following items are therefore out of scope for this specification:

* booking and related activities, e.g. availability, booking process and membership packages 
* participation data, e.g. statistics on attendance
* personal information, demographics and other information about event participants 
* APIs for publishing and discovering opportunity data

Support for third-party bookings is covered in the draft [[Open-Booking-API]] 
specification.

The [OpenActive Community Group](http://www.w3.org/community/openactive/) may 
produce additional specifications that address the other areas.

## Structure of this document

This specification is divided into two main sections:

1. **Introduction** - provides a broad definition of opportunity data and goals for this specification
2. **Key Concepts** - describes the key types of resources relevant to opportunity data, along with their relationships and common attributes
3. **Data Model** - a data model that maps the key concepts to some standard vocabularies

# Key Concepts

This section introduces the high-level data model for opportunity data. This includes a 
description of the:

* the resources that are relevant to opportunity data, e.g. places, events, activities, etc
* the relationships between those resources
* the main attributes that help to describe those resources, e.g. names, dates, etc

The model also helps to provide definitions of key terms that are used throughout this 
specification.

## Data Model Diagram

This diagram illustrates the resources and relationships that are introduced in the following sections.

      <figcaption>Opportunity data schema diagram</figcaption>
    </figure>

## Physical Activities

A __*Physical Activity*__ is an exercise, sport or other form of bodily movement 
that involves physical effort. Physical activities will usually have a well-understood, 
dictionary definition.

Examples of Physical Activities include walking, running, cycling, rugby, football and tennis

Activities should have a name. They might also be associated with one of more synonyms 
that provide alternative names for that activity. E.g. "Soccer" is a synonym 
for "Football". This additional information may be useful to help improve search engines and 
improve data collection.

Physical Activities may also have additional information associated with them. 
For example a sporting activity might be overseen by a governing body or federation.

Physical Activities might also be recognised by different bodies. In the UK certain 
activities are recognised as suitable for educational assessments, while others 
may be recognised by funding bodies like Sport England.

An __*Activity List*__ describes a set of Physical Activities. An Activity List may be a 
simple list of activity names. But an Activity List might also capture additional information. 
A common requirement is to describe relationships between Physical Activities.

One method of grouping activities is to define "broader" and "narrower" relationships.
For example Judo, Karate and Kendo are all more specific examples of the broader activity of 
"Martial Arts".

<ul>
<li>Martial Arts
<ul><li>Karate</li>
<li>Kendo</li>
<li>Judo</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

This type of grouping could also be used to describe the disciplines associated with 
Physical Activities. For example olympic and open water swimming.

An Activity List might also group Physical Activities into collections. For example 
swimming, water aerobics, and water polo might all be classified as "Water Sports".
Water polo and football might also be grouped into a collection of "Team Sports".

<ul>
<li>Team Sports
<ul><li>Football</li>
<li>Water Polo</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Water Sports
<ul><li>Swimming</li>
<li>Water Aerobics</li>
<li>Water Polo</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

An Activity List may include any number of collections of Physical Activities. As shown in the 
example above, an individual Physical Activity might be present in more than one grouping. 

Some systems may choose to use grouping and hierarchical relationships between 
Physical Activities to help people find opportunities to be active. For example 
a search engine might offer users results for all types of Martial Art, or for Karate specifically.

<div class="note">
The proposed model for Activity Lists is based on the [[SKOS]] standard for publishing controlled 
vocabularies.
</div>

<div class="note">
It is not a requirement that systems store, publish or use relationships between 
Physical Activities. A system may choose to treat Physical Activities as simple tags 
or categories associated with Events. Other systems may define a fixed list of 
Physical Activities that are used as a controlled vocabulary to guides user input 
and data collection. Others may adopt a more complex hierarchical approach.
</div>

<div class="note">
<p>__Developing a standard activity list__</p>
<p>This specification doesn't place any requirements on how applications manage 
or use Physical Activities or Activity Lists. There is no requirement that applications that 
implement this specification must adopt a single standardised list, or agree on standard groupings. The intention 
here is to just capture a useful model that can represent the variety of data currently in use.
</p>
<p>However there are benefits to the physical activity sector in convergence on a standard list of 
activities in order to improve discovery, reporting, etc. The OpenActive Community Group are developing 
a standard list as a separate activity. For more information see [[OpenActive-Activity-List]].
</div>

## Events

An __*Event*__ is an opportunity to take part in a Physical Activity. Events take place at a 
specific location (see below) at an agreed date and time.

Some Events are one-off occurrences. For example a fun run organised by a local group 
may run as a standalone event on a particular date. 

Other events take place on a regular __schedule__. For example a weekly gym class may 
run every Wednesday evening at 7pm. While a local walking club might meet on a Saturday 
morning once a month.

In order to simplify terminology we recommend the use of the term "Event" to 
refer to both individual occurrences and regularly occurring events. 

It is useful to publish data about both individual Events and those with recurring schedules. 
People looking for opportunities to be active will be interested in both specific questions 
("what can I do tomorrow") and more general information about scheduled activities.

Regardless of whether an event takes place only once or happens on a regular schedule, there 
is a range of additional information that may help describe the event to potential participants. 
This includes:

* the Physical Activity or Activities that will take place at the event
* the location (Place or Venue) in which it is taking place
* the Organiser of the event, which might be a person or an organisation
* the Programme used to structure the event
* descriptive attributes, such as its suitability for specific age or weight ranges
* general category information to tag the event as suitable for certain fitness levels, intensity, etc
* booking information, including price, attendance numbers and method of booking

<div class="note">
<p>There are a variety of ways to categorise and describe events. This includes restrictions on attendance, 
aspect of suitability for different audiences and fitness levels, and a mixture of pre-requisites such as the 
need for certain qualifications, membership or equipment.
</p>
<p>
The initial version of this specification prioritises capturing the essential elements of describing an event. The 
structured information about time, place and activity is supplemented with some basic descriptive properties. 
This also includes the ability to add "tags" to an event to capture a variety of categorisation elements. Future 
versions of this specification will use experience working with real-world data to decide the best approach of 
formalising these categories.
</p>
</div>

## Organisers (Persons and Organizations)

Events have __*organisers*__. An event organiser might be a __*Person*__ or an __*Organization*__. 
The organiser of an event is the person or organisation who arranged and/or hosts the event. The organizer 
will be the person or organisation who is ultimately responsible for an Event.

Examples of organisers might be coaches, or a local sports club.

Events may involve other named individuals or organisations. Examples might include named staff who will be participating 
in the event in addition to the main organiser. These are referred to as __*contributors*__.

In addition to their names, some systems may have additional information about organisers and contributors. 
E.g. links to their web sites, photos, logos or contact details.

<div class="note">
<p>__Applications must not publish personal data without permission__</p>
<p>
This specification provides a data model for publishing information about individual people, e.g. coaches, 
volunteers, etc. However applications <em class="rfc2119">MUST</em> respect privacy and data protection laws and must not publish 
data about individuals without their consent.
</p>
<p>
The ability to publish this type of data has been included because event organisers often choose to publicly 
share some information about themselves to help advertise an event. E.g. their name and some background on 
their qualifications or experience. But this information <em class="rfc2119">MUST</em> not be published as open data without getting the 
consent of the individual concerned.
</p>
</div>

## Places

Events take place in a __*location*__. But, depending on the activity, the location 
may be defined to different levels of precision. For example:

* A gym class may take place in a leisure centre at a specific address or other precisely defined location
* A cycling or walking event might start at a specific location, but will subsequently follow a route
* An exercise or running group might meet in an area of a local park, rather than at a specific address

In addition to this, data publishers will have different approaches for capturing location data.

Recognising this need for flexibility, this model proposes that a location can be specified as any of the 
following:

* a description, e.g. "Meet by the lake, in Victoria Park"
* an address
* a venue, such as a leisure centre, which might have an address and/or a latitude or longitude
* a facility within a larger venue, e.g. a football pitch which is part of a leisure centre

This specification uses __*Place*__ as a general concept to refer to all types of locations, venues and facilities. 

The concept of Place therefore covers general outdoor areas such as parks, event venues (e.g. a Leisure centre) 
and facilities within a venue (e.g. a squash court, running track, etc). Facilities are contained in Places.

A __Sports Activity Location__ is a type of Place that is used to describe a facilities within a broader 
Place. 

Places may have additional descriptive properties, for example:

* a name
* an address and/or geographic coordinates
* opening hours

## Programmes

Events are often organised and run in a variety of different ways. This tailoring 
might include adjusting the activity to a particular type of participant, demographic. 
Or it could include running the event in a particular style, e.g. with a fixed routine 
or sequence of activities.

A __*Programme*__ describes a method of carrying out a Physical Activity. Some programmes are very loosely defined. 
While others are more structured and may be run to a specific agenda or in a particular style.

Programmes are often associated with branding or marketing that helps participants understand more about what they 
can expect from an event of that format. Formats might be offered or overseen by specific organisations

Examples of programmes include:

* Les Mills BodyPump
* Learn to Row, from British Rowing
* Back to Netball, from England Netball

Programmes provide another means of tagging or describing Events to help describe them to 
participants. When participants are looking for opportunities they may be interested in 
discovering Events based on either the general activity (e.g. Running) or a specific 
programme (Back to Netball).

## Offers

Some opportunities are freely available for anyone to attend. Others are only available to members or 
paying attendees.

An __*Offer*__ is used to describe the terms under which a participant can pay to attend an event.

<div class="note">
<p>
The concept of an Offer is taken from Schema.org, which itself references the [Good Relations](http://www.heppnetz.de/projects/goodrelations/) 
vocabulary for ecommerce. The data model described in a later section is not intended as a 
complete specification. The concept is introduced in this version of specification to highlight 
the support available in Schema.org for associating offers with events. Later versions of the specification 
will explore the area of booking in more detail.
</p>
</div>

## Facility Use and Slots

Not all opportunities to be physically active are scheduled Events. Leisure centres and other locations also provide 
facilities (e.g. squash courts, pitches, table tennis tables) that are available for use by participants.

To manage demand these facilities are usually available for hire at specific times of day. These are referred to as __Slots__.
A Slot is an opportunity to use a facility at a specific time and a specific duration, e.g. from 10am for 30 minutes

Some facilities are permanent parts of a leisure centre (or other Place). For example tennis courts, football pitches, etc.

But many leisure centres have flexibility to reconfigure their spaces to support different, often mutually exclusive ways. 
For example an individual sports hall might be used as either a single indoor 5-a-side pitch, or as two separate badminton courts. 

Modelling the potential configurations of these spaces is outside the scope of this specification. The community group has 
chosen to take a more user centred view of describing opportunities to use facilities. This supports our 
primary use case of enabling the discovery of opportunities.

A __Facility Use__ is a product that is offered to potential participants. It reflects the ability to use or hire a 
facility at a specific location. A platform can publish data about the range of products on offer at a location, updating 
their availability as facilities are booked by participants.

The following properties will help to describe the specific Facility Use product on offer:

* basic descriptive attributes of the product, such as its name, description, etc
* the activity or activities for which the facility is to be used
* the location of the facility
* an offer to use the facility, for a specific price
* the Slots during which the product is available, including any associated offers

Some facility use products are opportunities to use a individual, identifiable facility, e.g. Tennis Court 1. 
These are referred to a as __Individual Facility Uses__. The location of these products will be a __Sports Activity Location__.

Otherwise, a Facility Use will describe an oppirtunity to use less permanent facilities, e.g. a table tennis table that will be moved into a sports hall on demand, or for an unnamed facility that will be allocated by a platform during booking. In this case the 
location will be for the Place in which the facility is available.

Facilities may be offered for use at a single price at any time of day, or the price may vary depending on on which Slot 
is used. 

As the use of facility is a self-directed activity it will differ from an Event in that is will not be lead, coached, etc.

# Data Model

The data model described in the following sections reuses existing standards and vocabularies which 
have then been extended to cover the additional requirements needs to support the publication of 
opportunity data.

The Simple Knowledge Organisation System ([[SKOS]]) is a W3C standard for publishing taxonomies and 
category schemes. It can be used to help publish and organise Activity Lists and to describe 
Physical Activities.

Schema.org [[SCHEMA-ORG]] provides an existing well-used and documented data model for publishing 
data to the web. It provides an existing model for describing Events, Organisations, People, and 
Places. 

Both standards are widely used, and can be used to publish data in a variety of structured formats, including 
[[JSON-LD]]. 

The __[*OpenActive Vocabulary*](https://www.openactive.io/ns/)__ [[OpenActive-Vocabulary]] is a custom vocabulary designed to support the publication of 
opportunity data. It defines a number of new terms that extend SKOS and Schema.org to cover additional 
requirements highlighted in this specification.

<div class="note">
Developers looking for a quick primer on the model and how to use it to structure opportunity data may want to refer to the 
[[Publishing-Opportunity-Data]] primer which provides many more examples. 
</div>

## Namespaces

The rest of this specification make use of the following namespaces:

<dl>
<dt>`dc:`</dt>
<dd>`http://purl.org/dc/terms/`</dd>
<dt>`schema:`</dt>
<dd>`http://schema.org/`</dd>
<dt>`skos:`</dt>
<dd>`http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#`</dd>
<dt>`oa:`</dt>
<dd>`https://www.openactive.io/ns/`</dd>
</dl>

<div class="note">
<p>
In the following sections all referenced terms have been qualified using their namespace prefix. This highlights the 
source vocabulary in which they have been defined. Terms have also been linked to their definitions.
</p>
<p>
The examples in each section use [[JSON-LD]] syntax and reference the [OpenActive JSON-LD context](https://www.openactive.io/ns/oa.jsonld) defined by [[OpenActive-Vocabulary]]. 
</p>
<p>
The context removes the need to use explicit namespace prefixes in the JSON documents. The context also maps the JSON-LD [`@type`](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#specifying-the-type) and [`@id`](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#node-identifiers) properties to simple keys (`type` and `id`). This further limits the amount of JSON-LD syntax exposed to developers.
</p>
</div>

## Identifying and Linking Resources

This specification adopts the same approach as Schema.org and encourages the use of URLs as unique identifiers for resources.

Information about Events, Places, Organizations and other types of resources should already have been published online to 
make that information accessible to users. Using existing URLs as identifiers avoids the need to define a new identifier 
scheme for resources described in opportunity data. 

There will generally be a single canonical URL for a resource, e.g. the homepage for an Organization or Place, or 
a public web page advertising an Event.

If there are several different URLs that may be used to identify a resource, it is recommended that systems use:

* a direct link to the resource that avoids redirects
* a stable link that will resolve to a public web page, accessible to both web browsers and applications
* a consistent link that will allow reusers to rely on the URL as an identifier, e.g. to merge in updated data

This specification provides three properties for identifying resources:

* `@id` - is used to [assign a globally unique URI to a resource](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#node-identifiers). This may resolve to further machine-readable 
 information about the resource, e.g. as a reference to an API endpoint. When supplied, this URI <em class="rfc2119">MUST</em> be stable and unchanging over time. Applications harvesting and 
 indexing opportunity data <em class="rfc2119">SHOULD</em> use this as the unique identifier for the resource
* [`schema:url`](http://schema.org/url) - provides a link to a public web page about the resource. Further machine-readable metadata 
<em class="rfc2119">MAY</em> be discoverable from that web page. Applications <em class="rfc2119">MUST</em> be able to use this URL as a means for providing users with a link to more information about a resource
* [`schema:identifier`](http://schema.org/identifier) - provides a means of sharing non-URI identifiers for a resource, e.g. a company or 
registration number for an Organization, or an internal identifier for an Event. Applications <em class="rfc2119">MAY</em> use this 
as a unique identifier for the resource, if there is no `@id` available.

In short, the `@id` property provides a unique global identifier, while the `schema:url` provides a means to provide a link to 
a public web page about a resource. 

If applicable then publishers may choose to use the same URI for these two properties. If an `@id` property is not provided then 
applications <em class="rfc2119">MAY</em> choose to rely on the value of the [`schema:url`](http://schema.org/url) property as a unique identifier.

The option to use two different URLs is useful when there is a need to distinguish between a unique identifier and a 
public resource. For example a platform hosting opportunity data may need to assign a unique identifier to a resource 
that is separate to its public web page.

<pre class="example" title="Simple event description"><code>
{
  "@context": "https://www.openactive.io/ns/oa.jsonld",
  "type": "Event",
  "id": "http://host.opportunity-data.com/id/12345",
  "url": "http://my-leisure-centre.example.org/events/1",
  "name": "Tai chi Class"
}
</code>
</pre>

In the above example the `@id` property provides a unique identifier across 
the hosting application. But the public URL for the Event uses a separate, 
customer-specific domain.

## Required and Optional Properties

The following sections include more detail about the properties available to 
describe each type of resource. Some properties are considered to be essential 
to ensure the provision of a minimally useful set of information about each 
resource. These <em class="rfc2119">REQUIRED</em> properties 
<em class="rfc2119">MUST</em> be provided.

All other properties are considered to be <em class="rfc2119">OPTIONAL</em>. 
Some properties have been marked as <em class="rfc2119">RECOMMENDED</em>. 
Publishers <em class="rfc2119">SHOULD</em> provide these properties if it is 
feasible to do so, as they will improve the quality and usability of their data.

Data publishers <em class="rfc2119">MAY</em> include additional properties, 
e.g. from Schema.org or other vocabularies when helpful to describe their data. 
See the section on **Extending the Model** for more information.

Applications that consume opportunity data <em class="rfc2119">MUST</em> ignore 
any properties that they don't understand. This allows data publishing practices 
within the sector to evolve as required.

## Describing Events (<code>schema:Event</code>)

<p>
The Schema.org [`schema:Event`](https://schema.org/Event) type corresponds to the definition of 
Event given earlier in this specification. The properties and relationships associated with the 
[`schema:Event`](https://schema.org/Event) type can all be used to describe events.
</p>
<p>
The following table illustrates how the essential aspects of describing an event map to 
existing Schema.org properties and/or properties defined in the OpenActive Vocabulary.

<p>
The following example shows a simple event description, including its start time and duration:
</p>

<pre class="example" title="Simple event description"><code>
{
  "@context": "https://www.openactive.io/ns/oa.jsonld",
  "type": "Event",

  "startDate": "2017-03-22T20:00:00-05:00",
  "duration": "PT60M"
}
</code>
</pre>

This basic description can be improved by providing information about its location and organizer.

<pre class="example" title="Adding a venue and an organizer"><code>
{

      "streetAddress": "1 High Street",
      "addressLocality": "Bristol",
      "postalCode": "BS1 4SD"
    }
  }  
}
</code></pre>

### Relating Events to Physical Activities

<p>
The [`oa:activity`](https://www.openactive.io/ns/#activity) property allows an 
event to be associated with one or more Physical Activities. The Physical 
Activities used to describe an event may be drawn from a standard Activity 
List, e.g. the OpenActive Activity List ([[OpenActive-Activity-List]]). 
</p>

<pre class="example" title="Using activities from an Activity List"><code>
{
  "@context": "https://www.openactive.io/ns/oa.jsonld",
  "type": "Event",
  "url": "http://www.example.org/events/1",
  "name": "Tai chi Class",
  "description": "A tai chi class intended for beginners",
  "startDate": "2017-03-22T20:00:00-05:00",
  "duration": "PT60M",
  "activity": [{
    "id": "https://www.openactive.io/activity-list/#c16df6ed-a4a0-4275-a8c3-1c8cff56856f",
    "type": "Concept",
    "prefLabel": "Tai Chi",
    "inScheme": "https://www.openactive.io/activity-list/"
  }]
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>
Applications could include additional information, e.g. alternate labels for convenience of consumers.
</p>

### Categorising events

<p>
The [`oa:category`](https://www.openactive.io/ns/#category) property can be 
used to associate an Event with one or more tags that provide some extra 
context about an event. This might include general information on the intensity 
and suitability. While this property can be used to add any arbitrary tags to 
an Event, a common use case is the need to tag an event as being suitable for 
a specific type of audience, e.g. Beginners. Where this information is 
available, the [`oa:level`](https://www.openactive.io/ns/#level) property 
can be used in preference to [`oa:category`](https://www.openactive.io/ns/#category). 
</p>
<p>
If an application does not distinguish between different types of tags 
associated with an Event, then it <em class="rfc2119">SHOULD</em> use the 
more general [`oa:category`](https://www.openactive.io/ns/#category) property.
</p>

<pre class="example" title="Tagging an Event"><code>
{
  "@context": "https://www.openactive.io/ns/oa.jsonld",
  "type": "Event",
  "url": "http://www.example.org/events/1",
  "name": "Tai chi Class",
  "description": "A tai chi class intended for beginners",
  "startDate": "2017-03-22T20:00:00-05:00",
  "duration": "PT60M",
  "category": [{
    "type: "Concept",
    "prefLabel": "Suitable For All"
    },
    {
    "type: "Concept",
    "prefLabel": "Low Intensity"
  }],
  "level": [{
    "type: "Concept",
    "prefLabel": "Beginner"
  }]
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>
Where an application is using a controlled vocabulary it 
<em class="rfc2119">SHOULD</em> publish that vocabulary as structured data.
</p>

<div class="note">
In future, the OpenActive Community Group may decide to define and recommend 
some controlled vocabularies for use in these properties. At present the 
values of these properties are left deliberately open to encourage publication 
of open data that may inform future standardisation.
</div>

### Describing Event Suitability

<p>
There are a variety of ways in which the suitability of an event for specific 
audiences can be expressed. This includes specifying that 
an event is:
</p>

* suited for a specific age range
* suited for people with specific levels of experience ([`oa:level`](https://www.openactive.io/ns/#level))
* restricted to a male, female or mixed audience

#### Age Ranges

<p>
Age ranges are specified using the [`oa:ageRange`](https://www.openactive.io/ns/#ageRange) property. 
The value is a [`schema:QuantitativeValue`](http://schema.org/QuantitativeValue) 
which should have [minValue](http://schema.org/minValue) or 
[maxValue](http://schema.org/maxValue) properties. These properties specify an 
inclusive minimum and maximum age range for participants.
</p>

<p>
Data publishers using the [`oa:ageRange`](https://www.openactive.io/ns/#ageRange) 
property MUST ensure that it has:
</p>

* a `type` of [`schema:QuantitativeValue`](http://schema.org/QuantitativeValue)
* at least one of the `minValue` or `maxValue`properties

<p>
Data consumers SHOULD assume that:
</p>

* if there is no `ageRange` property for an Event, then the event is suitable for adults only. E.g. as if the `minValue` has been specified as `18`
* if an `ageRange` is provided without a `minValue` property, then there is no minimum age for the `Event`
* if an `ageRange` is provided without a `maxValue` property, then there is no maximum age for the `Event`
* if an `ageRange` is provided with a `minValue` of 0, and there is no `maxValue` property then the Event is suitable for all

<p>
The following example illustrates how to specify an Event that is suitable for people aged 60 or over.
</p>

<pre class="example" title="Age range example"><code>
{
  "@context": "https://www.openactive.io/ns/oa.jsonld",
  "type": "Event",
  "url": "http://www.example.org/events/1",
  "name": "Tai chi Class",
  "ageRange": {
     "type": "QuantitativeValue",
     "minValue": 60
  }
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>
The following example illustrates an Event that is suitable for all ages. 
This is indicated by providing an `minValue` property with a value of zero and 
no `maxValue` property.
</p>

<pre class="example" title="Age range - suitable for all example"><code>
{
  "@context": "https://www.openactive.io/ns/oa.jsonld",
  "type": "Event",
  "url": "http://www.example.org/events/1",
  "name": "Exercise in the park",
  "ageRange": {
     "type": "QuantitativeValue",
     "minValue": 0
  }
}
</code>
</pre>

#### Gender Restriction

<p>
Attendance at some events is limited to certain audiences. For example a 
female only gym class. The [`oa:genderRestriction`](https://www.openactive.io/ns/#genderRestriction) 
property can be used to specify these restrictions.
</p>

<p>
Data publishers using this property MUST use one of the following values:
</p>

* `https://www.openactive.io/ns#None` indicating that the event has no restrictions
* `https://www.openactive.io/ns#Male` indicating that the event is restricted to the male gender
* `https://www.openactive.io/ns#Female` indicating that the event is restricted to the female gender

<p>
If the `genderRestriction` property is not supplied for an Event, then data 
consumers SHOULD NOT assume a default value, the value should be treated as 
`null`. When searching or filtering for gender restricted Events, data 
consumers SHOULD remove Events with a `null` value. 
</p>

<p>
Invalid values for the `genderRestriction` property SHOULD be treated as `null`.
</p>

<pre class="example" title="Gender restriction example"><code>
{
  "@context": "https://www.openactive.io/ns/oa.jsonld",
  "type": "Event",
  "url": "http://www.example.org/events/1",
  "name": "Gym class",
  "genderRestriction": "http://www.openactive.io/ns#Female"
}
</code>
</pre>

### Adding programmes

Events can be associated with a Programme using the 
[`oa:programme`](https://www.openactive.io/ns/#programme) property. A programme
is a [`schema:Brand`](http://schema.org/Brand) object.

<pre class="example" title="Tagging an Event"><code>
{
  "@context": "https://www.openactive.io/ns/oa.jsonld",
  "type": "Event",
  "url": "http://www.example.org/events/1",
  "name": "Rowing Class",
  "description": "A rowing class for beginners",
  "startDate": "2017-04-01T08:00:00Z",
  "duration": "PT60M",
  "programme": {
    "type": "Brand",
    "name": "Learn to Row",
    "url": "https://www.britishrowing.org/go-rowing/learn-to-row/",
    "description": "Getting started in rowing couldn’t be easier!"
  }
}
</code>
</pre>

### Describing scheduled events

<div class="note">
**Schema.org support for recurring events**

**[Issue 2](https://github.com/openactive/modelling-opportunity-data/issues/2)**: Schema.org support for recurring events

This specification relies on some pending changes to Schema.org that will add recurrence rules to Events. The [proposal](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/pull/1693) has been accepted, but is not yet formally part of the model.

We expect that this proposal will become part of Schema.org in due course. This process will be driven by implementation experience and feedback from the community. On that basis we have included the terms in 
specification. The following section is written on that basis. However both 
publishers and consumers should be aware that this is an area that may change in future versions.
</div>

The following example illustrates basic usage of the [`schema:eventSchedule`](http://pending.schema.org/eventSchedule) property to associate an `Event` with a [`schema:Schedule`](http://pending.schema.org/Schedule). The data describes a Tai Chi class that occurs every Wednesday at 7pm

<pre class="example" title="Adding an event schedule"><code>
{
  "@context": "https://www.openactive.io/ns/oa.jsonld",
  "type": "Event",
  "url": "http://www.example.org/events/1",
  "name": "Tai chi Class",
  "description": "A tai chi class intended for beginners",
  "duration": "PT60M",
  "eventSchedule": {
     "type": "Schedule",
     "startDate": "2017-01-01",
     "endDate": "2017-12-31",
     "repeatFrequency": "P1W",
     "byDay": "http://schema.org/Wednesday",
     "startTime": "19:00Z",
     "endTime": "20:00Z",
     "duration": "P1H"
  }  
}
</code>
</pre>

### Describing event availability

<p>
Schema.org provides a couple of basic properties for describing the 
maximum ([`schema:maximumAttendeeCapacity`](http://schema.org/maximumAttendeeCapacity)) 
and remaining capacity ([`schema:remainingAttendeeCapacity`](http://schema.org/remainingAttendeeCapacity)) for an [`schema:Event`](https://schema.org/Event). 
</p>
<p>
These properties can be used to provide some basic availability information for scheduled events. These are illustrated in the following example which states that a Tai chi class can be attended by up to 20 people and that there are 4 spaces remaining.
</p>

<pre class="example" title="Basic event availability"><code>
{
  "@context": "https://www.openactive.io/ns/oa.jsonld",
  "type": "Event",
  "url": "http://www.example.org/events/1",
  "name": "Tai chi Class",
  "description": "A tai chi class intended for beginners",
  "startDate": "2017-03-22T20:00:00-05:00",
  "duration": "PT60M",
  "maximumAttendeeCapacity": 20,
  "remainingAttendeeCapacity": 4
}
</code>
</pre>

### Indicating the status of an event

<p>
An [`schema:Event`](https://schema.org/Event) may occasionally be rescheduled or cancelled. Schema.org provides the [`schema:eventStatus`](http://schema.org/eventStatus) property for indicating the current status of an event.
</p>

<p>
The property can have several standardised values which are defined by the [`schema:EventStatusType`](http://schema.org/EventStatusType) enumeration. The property values should therefore be one of the following URIs:
</p>

* Cancelled: `http://schema.org/EventCancelled`
* Postponed: `http://schema.org/EventPostponed`
* Rescheduled: `http://schema.org/EventRescheduled`
* Scheduled: `http://schema.org/EventScheduled`

<p>
If the status property is not provided then applications <em class="rfc2119">SHOULD</em> assume a default value of `http://schema.org/EventScheduled`.
</p>

<p>
The following example shows a Tai chi class that has been cancelled:
</p>

<pre class="example" title="A cancelled event"><code>
{
  "@context": "https://www.openactive.io/ns/oa.jsonld",
  "type": "Event",
  "url": "http://www.example.org/events/1",
  "name": "Tai chi Class",
  "description": "A tai chi class intended for beginners",
  "startDate": "2017-03-22T20:00:00-05:00",
  "duration": "PT60M",
  "eventStatus": "http://schema.org/EventCancelled"
}
</code>
</pre>

### Describing support for disabilities at events

<p>
This specification defines several ways to capture information from organisers 
about the types of support they provide for people with disabilities or 
other impairments. This includes: 
</p>

* listing the types of disability or impairment that are, or can be accommodated at an event using the [`oa:accessibilitySupport`](https://www.openactive.io/ns/#accessibilitySupport) property
* providing additional notes for participants using the [`oa:accessibilityInformation`](https://www.openactive.io/ns/#accessibilityInformation) property

<p>
Examples of using these are shown below:
</p>

<pre class="example" title="Accessibility information"><code>
{
  "@context": "https://www.openactive.io/ns/oa.jsonld",
  "type": "Event",
  "url": "http://www.example.org/events/1",
  "name": "Tai chi Class",
  "description": "A tai chi class intended for beginners",
  "startDate": "2017-03-22T20:00:00-05:00",
  "duration": "PT60M",
  "accessibilitySupport": ["Hearing Impairment", "Visual Impairment"],
  "accessibilityInformation": "The location is fully accessible, please contact the organiser if you have questions"
}
</code>
</pre>

## Describing Locations (<code>schema:Place</code>)

This specification recommends use of the [`schema:Place`](https://schema.org/Place) 
and [`schema:SportsActivityLocation`](https://schema.org/SportsActivityLocation) 
types for describing locations. 

The [`schema:location`](https://schema.org/location) property can be used to 
relate an [`schema:Event`](https://schema.org/Event) 
or [`oa:FacilityUse`](https://www.openactive.io/ns#FacilityUse) to a Place.

The following table lists a number of properties that can be used to 
describe a [`schema:Place`](https://schema.org/Place) 

<table>

    </tr>    
  </tbody>   
</table>

This example illustrates a simple place description. Building on the previous example it adds the name, telephone number and website address for the leisure centre:

<pre class="example" title="Describing a leisure centre"><code>
{
  "@context": "https://www.openactive.io/ns/oa.jsonld",

      "addressCountry": "UK"
  },
  "telephone": "+44 (0)1225 486905"    
}
</code></pre>

A more precise geographical location can be provided by adding a [`schema:geo`](https://schema.org/geo) property:

<pre class="example" title="Locating a leisure centre"><code>

### Describing Addresses

Schema.org provides the following properties for publishing address data using the [`schema:PostalAddress`](https://schema.org/PostalAddress) type.

<table>

</table>

The following example shows how to markup a simple address:

<pre class="example" title="An Address">
<code>
{
  "@context": "https://www.openactive.io/ns/oa.jsonld",
  "type": "PostalAddress",
  "streetAddress": "North Parade Road",
  "addressLocality": "Bath",
  "addressRegion": "Somerset",
  "postalCode": "BA2 4ET",
  "addressCountry": "UK"
}
</code>
</pre>

### Describing Amenities

It can be useful to describe the amenities (e.g. characteristics, services or other features) available at a location. 

Schema.org provides the [`schema:amenityFeature`](http://schema.org/amenityFeature) property for specifying an list of amenities that are available or unavailable at a specific [`schema:Place`](http://schema.org/Place). The value of a the property is an array of objects that describe the individual amenities. 

To improve consistency in how amenities are published, this specification defines some common types of amenities:

* [`ChangingRooms`](https://www.openactive.io/ns#ChangingRooms)
* [`Showers`](https://www.openactive.io/ns#Showers)
* [`PublicToilets`](https://www.openactive.io/ns#PublicToilets)
* [`Lockers`](https://www.openactive.io/ns#Lockers)
* [`Towels`](https://www.openactive.io/ns#Towels)
* [`Creche`](https://www.openactive.io/ns#Creche)
* [`Parking`](https://www.openactive.io/ns#Parking)
* [`BabyChanging`](https://www.openactive.io/ns#BabyChanging)

Publishers SHOULD use one of these types when applicable. If there is no pre-defined type then data publishers MUST use the more generic [`schema:LocationFeatureSpecification`](http://schema.org/LocationFeatureSpecification) type. 

This avoids the need for data consumers to have to rely on the `name` value to identify common amenities that may otherwise be named differently (e.g. "Changing Rooms, "Changing Facilities", etc).

<pre class="example" title="Amenity example"><code>
{
  "type": "Place",
  "amenityFeature": [
     {
        "type": "ChangingRooms",
        "name": "Changing Facilities",
        "value": true
     }
  ]
}
</code></pre>

Publishers MUST include the `type`, `name` and `value` properties for each amenity. A `value` of `false` indicates that a specific amenity is not available.

Additional information MAY be provided about each of the amenities, using properties from the [`schema:LocationFeatureSpecification`](http://schema.org/LocationFeatureSpecification) type. For example, specifying opening hours ([`schema:hoursAvailable`](http://schema.org/hoursAvailable)) or to add a description ([`schema:description`](http://schema.org/description)).

The list of pre-defined amenties MAY be revised in future specifications based on feedback from the community. 

In the meantime additional types of amenities can be specified using the more generic [`schema:LocationFeatureSpecification`](http://schema.org/LocationFeatureSpecification) type as shown below:

<pre class="example" title="Generic amenity type example"><code>
{
  "type": "Place",
  "amenityFeature": [
     {
        "type": "LocationFeatureSpecification",
        "name": "Outdoor seating",
        "value": true
     }
  ]
}
</code></pre>


### Describing Facilities at a Location

Facilities such as swimming pools, courts, etc available at a location can 
be expressed using the containment properties 
([`schema:containedInPlace`](https://schema.org/containedInPlace) 
and [`schema:containsPlace`](https://schema.org/containsPlace)). The following example illustrates how to describe that a Leisure Centre includes a gym:

<pre class="example" title="Describing a leisure centre"><code>
{
  "@context": "https://www.openactive.io/ns/oa.jsonld",
  "type": "Place",
  "url": "http://www.better.org.uk/leisure-centre/banes/bath-sports-and-leisure-centre",
  "name": "Bath Sports and Leisure Centre",
  "address": {
      "type": "PostalAddress",
      "streetAddress": "North Parade Road",
      "addressLocality": "Bath",
      "addressRegion": "Somerset",
      "postalCode": "BA2 4ET",
      "addressCountry": "UK"
  },
  "containsPlace": [{
    "type": "SportsActivityLocation",
    "url": "http://www.better.org.uk/leisure-centre/banes/bath-sports-and-leisure-centre/gym",
    "name": "Gym"
  }]    
}
</code></pre>

## Describing Organisers (<code>schema:Person</code> and <code>schema:Organization</code>)

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Applications must not publish personal data without permission</strong></p>
<p>
While the <a href="https://schema.org/Person"><code>schema:Person</code></a> type allows a variety of information to be published about a 
person, applications <em class="rfc2119">MUST</em> not publish this information as open data without consent.
</p>
</div>

To describe the people and organisations involving in organising Events, Schema.org provides the [`schema:Person`](https://schema.org/Person) and [`schema:Organization`](https://schema.org/Organization) types.

People and organisations can be associated with an Event using the [`schema:organizer`](http://schema.org/organizer), [`schema:contributor`](http://schema.org/contributor) or [`oa:leader`](https://www.openactive.io/ns/#leader) properties. These allow some flexibility in defining how a person or organisation is associated with an event. For example an event may be:

* organized by an club (`schema:organizer`)
* be led by a specific coach (`oa:leader`) 
* and involve other named participants (`oa:contributor`)

To help ensure that publishers apply these properties in consistent ways, it is recommended that:

* For events taking place in a gym, the organizer should be listed as the gym (an [`schema:Organization`](https://schema.org/Organization))
* For "user generated" events in a booking system, the organizer should be the account under which the events were created, rather than the booking system. The instructor for the event can be specified as the `oa:leader` or `oa:contributor`
* For franchised events (e.g. Clubbercise), the organiser should be the franchisee, as they are ultimately responsible for organising that specific event

Both the [`schema:Person`](https://schema.org/Person) and [`schema:Organization`](https://schema.org/Organization) types support a common set of properties that capture the basic information required for publishing opportunity data.

<table>

    <th>Property</th>
    <th>Status</th>
    <th>Format</th>
    <th>Notes</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>`@type`</td>
      <td><em class="rfc2119">REQUIRED</em></td>
      <td>String</td>
      <td>Person or Organization</td>

      <td>Array of [`schema:ImageObject`](https://schema.org/ImageObject)</td>
      <td>Logo for an organization</td>
    </tr>

  </tbody>   
</table>

The following example illustrates how to associate an [`schema:Organization`](https://schema.org/Organization) with an event:

<pre class="example" title="Specifying an organiser"><code>
{
  "@context": "https://www.openactive.io/ns/oa.jsonld",

        "url": "http://www.example.org/clubs/1/logo.png"
    }]    
  }]
}
</code>
</pre>

## Describing Activity Lists (<code>skos:ConceptScheme</code>) and Physical Activity (<code>skos:Concept</code>)


List of Physical Activities are controlled vocabularies published using the types and properties defined by the [SKOS](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/) standard. That 
standard covers all the requirements [outlined in the concept model](#physical-activities), allowing:

* activities to be organised into hierarchies to capture broader-narrow relationships, e.g. "Martial Arts" and "Judo"
* sharing of alternative labels to support search and indexing
* the sharing of standard codes to support data integration

The [[OpenActive-Activity-List]] provides an openly licensed standard activity list that can be used by publishers. But where a publisher needs to publish their own list, then they can use the properties defined in the SKOS specification, as follows:

<table>
  <thead>
    <th>Property</th>
    <th>Status</th>
    <th>Format</th>
    <th>Notes</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>`@type`</td>
      <td><em class="rfc2119">REQUIRED</em></td>
      <td>String</td>
      <td>ConceptScheme</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`@id`</td>
      <td><em class="rfc2119">REQUIRED</em></td>
      <td>URL</td>      
      <td>A URI providing a unique identifier for the resource</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>[`schema:url`](https://schema.org/url)</td>
      <td><em class="rfc2119">REQUIRED</em></td>
      <td>URL</td>
      <td>A URL that links to the Activity List</td>
    </tr>    
    <tr>
      <td>[`dc:title`](http://purl.org/dc/terms/title)</td>
      <td><em class="rfc2119">REQUIRED</em></td>
      <td>String</td>
      <td>Title of the Activity List</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>[`schema:description`](https://schema.org/description)</td>
      <td><em class="rfc2119">RECOMMENDED</em></td>
      <td>String</td>
      <td>Description of the activity list</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>[`dc:license`](http://purl.org/dc/terms/license)</td>
      <td><em class="rfc2119">RECOMMENDED</em></td>
      <td>Reference to the license under which the activity list has been published</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>[`oa:concepts`](https://www.openactive.org/ns#concepts)</td>
      <td><em class="rfc2119">REQUIRED</em></td>
      <td>Array of [`skos:Concept`](https://www.w3.org/2009/08/skos-reference/skos.html#Concept)</td>
      <td>List of concepts that make up the list</td>
    </tr>    
  </tbody>   
</table>

The following example illustrates the basic structure of an activity list:

<pre class="example" title="Publishing an activity list"><code>
{
  "@context": "https://www.openactive.io/ns/oa.jsonld",
  "type": "ConceptScheme",
  "id": "http://www.example.org/activity-list",

  "title": "Activity List",
  "description": "An example activity list",
  "concepts": [{
    "type": "Concept",
    "prefLabel": "Martial Arts",
    "narrower": {
      "type": "Concept",
      "prefLabel": "Tai Chi"
    }    
  }]
}
</code>
</pre>

### Describing Physical Activities

The following properties from the [[SKOS]] specification can be used to describe physical activities.

<table>
  <thead>
    <th>Property</th>
    <th>Status</th>

      <td>String</td>
      <td>Provides a unique code or identifier for an activity</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

  "altLabel": "Tai-Chi",
  "inScheme": "http://www.example.org/activity-list"
}
</code>
</pre>

## Describing Offers (<code>schema:Offer</code>)

To indicate that a `schema:Event` is only available to paid attendees, opportunity data provides may include details of the offers available to participants. The [`schema:Offer`](http://schema.org/Offer) type provides some basic properties for indicating the price and availability of Offers.

<table>
  <thead>

</div>

<p></p>

## Describing Slots (<code>oa:Slot</code>)

A Slot is an opportunity to use a facility at a specific time and for a 
specified duration. A Slot is therefore a specific type of Event, although 
it has a more constrained set of properties.

A series of Slots describes a calendar during which a facility is available 
for use.

Slots are always associated with a [`oa:FacilityUse`](https://www.openactive.io/ns/#FacilityUse) 
product which may link to more detail about the facility on offer and the costs 
for hire.

    </tr>    
  </tbody>   
</table>

Examples of describing a Slot are given in the next section.

## Describing Facility Use (<code>oa:FacilityUse</code>, <code>oa:IndividualFacilityUse</code>)

A Facility Use is a product. It describes an opportunity to use either one of 
a group of facilities (<code>oa:FacilityUse</code>) or a individual facility 
(<code>oa:IndividualFacilityUse</code>). 

The opportunity to use a facility is divided into a calendar of Slots, which 
allow a participant to use that facility for a specified time and duration.

The following example describes opportunities to use table tennis facilities at 
a leisure centre. By default use of a table is for 30 minutes and costs ten 
pounds.

However at specific times the cost to use a table increases. This is indicated 
by offers associated with the second Slot.

In both cases a maximum of four tables are available. In the example, only one 
table remains for use in the first slot, while the second has three.

<div class="note">
<p>
The community group feels that the data model proposed in this section adequately covers the primary use cases relating to publishing data on opportunities to hire and use facilities</p>
<p>However we recognise that there may be some consequences on the volume of data shared via [RPDE feeds](https://www.openactive.io/realtime-paged-data-exchange/). Specifically, for multi-use facilities the booking of mutually exclusive configurations will end up increasing the volume of updates that need to be communicated to users.
</p>
<p>The community group has documented this issue and [requests feedback from publishers and users](https://github.com/openactive/modelling-opportunity-data/issues/73) based on implementation feedback before deciding how to address the issue.</p>
</div>

<p></p>

## Extending the Model

The previous sections describe how to publish opportunity data using a combination of existing and new vocabularies. 
But this approach may not address every requirement. Specific applications may need custom extensions and the community may need to 
revise or improve the core model presented here. 

Future versions of the specification may have a wider scope, e.g. to support description of facilities, equipment, 
event booking or accreditation schemes for sporting organisations.

With this in mind, the following sections briefly outline some expected ways in which this specification and the practice of 
publishing of opportunity data may evolve.

To support changing practice, consumers of opportunity data <em class="rfc2119">SHOULD</em> be liberal in what they accept 
from data publishers, to allow the use of additional properties.

### Versioning Policy

The broad goal is to ensure that future versions of this specification 
remain backwards compatible. This will ensure that published data remains valid. 

New types of resource, relationships and properties can easily be added to 
extend the model without impacting existing data. Potential breaking changes 
would include changing the definitions of existing properties, or removing 
them from the specification.

To avoid this, the goal will be to:

* evolve the definitions of existing properties to broadly retain their current meaning and legal values.
* deprecate, rather than remove properties that are judged, based on implementation experience, to be less useful or confusing. Deprecated properties will be clearly marked in both the human and machine-readable versions of the OpenActive namespace.
* ensure that conformance criteria are loosely defined, balancing the need to be able to validate data against a desire to allow 
some evolution in practice
* use version numbering to indicate potential for breaking changes. Minor versions, 
e.g. 1.1, 2.1, etc should be backwards compatible. Major versions, e.g. 2.0, 3.0 
are likely to include breaking changes.

Proposed changes to the specification will also be communicated in advance of 
their formal release, through the sharing of public Editor's Drafts. This will 
provide opportunities for both publishers and users of the data to update their applications. 

### Relationship with Schema.org and SKOS

This specification draws heavily on [[SCHEMA-ORG]] and [[SKOS]] to define its 
core data model. This is supplemented with additional custom types and properties 
that capture additional requirements for the physical activity sector.

The [[SCHEMA-ORG]] and [[SKOS]] specifications define additional properties 
that are not directly referenced in this document.

Rather than reflect the whole of these specification in this document, we have 
chosen to include those types and properties that:

* are necessary to document a basic framework for publishing opportunity data
* are useful to highlight to encourage consistent usage across the community
* have stricter conformance rules that used by [[SCHEMA-ORG]]. For example where 
we have agreed to specific uses of properties to increase quality and consistency 
in how data is being published

However data publishers are free to use any additional types and properties 
where useful. [[SCHEMA-ORG]] in particular provides a source of a wide range 
of additional properties for describing Events, Places, Organisations, etc. 

For example an application may wish to share reviews of events, places or 
clubs. The [`schema:review`](https://schema.org/review) property and its 
related data model can be used for this purpose, without requiring revisions 
to this specification.

### Defining Custom Vocabularies

Individual publishers, or members of the community may identify new requirements 
for publishing opportunity data that are not covered by this specification or 
[[SCHEMA-ORG]].

These new requirements might result in:

* submission of proposals to the OpenActive Community Group for revisions to this 
specification
* creation of new specifications that support the needs fo specific types of publisher. 
For example a group of publishers might wish to define a detailed specification for 
describing the characteristics of cycle tracks
* creation of bespoke properties that support the needs of a specific publisher 
and their data users

In all of these cases we encourage discussion of requirements and extensions via 
the OpenActive Community Group, as the primary forum for standarding the 
publication of opportunity data.

#### Defining and Using Custom Namespaces

The data model described in this specification is defined in 
the [OpenActive JSON-LD context](https://www.openactive.io/ns/oa.jsonld) defined by [[OpenActive-Vocabulary]].

They <em class="rfc2119">SHOULD</em> also:

* publish public, human-readable documentation that describes their extension, 
including any custom properties, types and controlled vocabularies that are 
being used
* share the documentation with the OpenActive community group
* look for opportunities to align their data model with revisions to the  
standard and other extensions defined in the community

Publish <em class="rfc2119">MUST</em> also

* avoid using names for custom types or properties that clash with the core 
data model
* publish a custom [JSON-LD context](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#the-context) to provide a machine-readable version of their 
extension 
* include a reference to their context in their published data

A full tutorial on creating JSON-LD contexts is outside the scope of this specification. 

The following example shows a simple custom JSON-LD context that defines a new namespace
`ext` and three custom properties.

<pre class="example" title="Example of a custom context"><code>
{
   "@context":{
      "label":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label",
      "xsd":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#",
      "ext":"http://example.org/jsonld#",
      "id":"@id"
   },
   "ext:myCustomProperty":{
      "id":"ext:myCustomProperty",
      "label":"This is the label"
   },
   "ext:myNumericProperty":{
      "id":"ext:myNumericProperty",
      "label":"This is a property with a number value",
      "@type":"xsd:integer"
   },
   "ext:myURLProperty":{
      "id":"ext:myURLProperty",
      "label":"This is a property with a URI value",
      "@type":"@id"
   }
}
</code></pre>

[[JSON-LD]] allows data to be [published with reference to multiple contexts](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#advanced-context-usage). 

Assuming that the previous JSON-LD context was published to `https://example.org/custom.jsonld`, then 
the following example shows how to use this extension:

<pre class="example" title="Example of a custom context"><code>
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.openactive.io/ns/oa.jsonld",
    "https://example.org/custom.jsonld"
  ],
  "type": "Event",
  "ext:myCustomProperty": "foo"
}
</code></pre>

Publishers <em class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</em> use unprefixed property and type 
names.

Using a separate context and prefixed names will help to clarify for users when 
a dataset is referencing one or more extensions.

#### Beta Namespace

The [[OpenActive-Beta-Namespace]] provides a custom namespace that can be used 
by publishers experimenting with new properties that are likely to be added to 
the core specification.

It is defined as a convenience to help document properties that are in active 
testing and review by the community. Publishers <em class="rfc2119">SHOULD NOT</em> 
assume that properties in the `beta` namespace will either be added to the core 
specification or be included in the namespace over the long term.

Publishers needing additional custom properties <em class="rfc2119">SHOULD</em> 
define their own namespace.
